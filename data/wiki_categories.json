Panorama of a section of ''A Thousand Li of Mountains and Rivers'', a 12th-century painting by Song dynasty artist [[Wang Ximeng]].}}\n\nIn the perspective of the history of art,&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from early [[pre-historic art]] to [[contemporary art]]; however, some theorists feel that the typical concept of &quot;artistic works&quot; fits less well outside modern Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James &quot;Art History and Images That Are Not Art&quot;, ''The Art Bulletin'', Vol. 47, No. 4 (December 1995), with previous bibliography. &quot;Non-Western images are not well described in terms of art, and neither are medieval paintings that were made in the absence of humanist ideas of artistic value&quot;. 553&lt;/ref&gt; One early sense of the definition of ''art'' is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to &quot;skill&quot; or &quot;craft,&quot; as associated with words such as &quot;artisan.&quot; English words derived from this meaning include ''artifact'', ''artificial'', ''artifice'', ''medical arts'', and ''military arts''. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its [[etymology]].\n[[File:Teke bottle.JPG|thumb|upright|20th-century bottle, [[Twa]] peoples, Rwanda, Artistic works may serve practical functions, in addition to their decorative value.]]\n\nOver time, philosophers like [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Socrates]] and [[Kant]], among others, questioned the meaning of art.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 73\u201396&lt;/ref&gt; Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the [[muses]], and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]] ''(265a\u2013c), and yet in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']]'' wants to outlaw Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. In ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the ''Republic''. The dialogue ''Ion'' suggests that [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 40\u201372&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWith regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb]]ic poetry and music to be [[Mimesis|mimetic]] or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' I 1447a&lt;/ref&gt; For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation\u2014through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' IV&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe more recent and specific sense of the word ''art'' as an abbreviation for ''creative art'' or ''fine art'' emerged in the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''. [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;120&lt;/ref&gt; Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or ''finer'' work of art.\n\nWithin this latter sense, the word ''art'' may refer to several things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv) the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (''art'' as discipline) are a collection of disciplines which produce ''artworks'' (''art'' as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret (art as experience).  Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. Works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. For some scholars, such as [[Kant]], the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 287\u2013326&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOften, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered [[commercial art]] instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered [[applied art]]. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.&lt;ref&gt;David Novitz, ''The Boundaries of Art'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt; However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see [[aesthetics]]); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong [[emotion]]s. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.\n\nThe nature of art has been described by philosopher [[Richard Wollheim]] as &quot;one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wollheim, ''Art and its objects'', p. 1, 2nd ed., 1980, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-29706-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating [[Formalism (art)|formal elements]] for their own sake, and as ''[[mimesis]]'' or [[Representation (arts)|representation]]. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=Levinson5/&gt; [[Leo Tolstoy]] identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levinson5&quot;&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 5. {{ISBN|0-19-927945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[R. G. Collingwood]] advanced the [[Idealism|idealist]] view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator.&lt;ref&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 16. {{ISBN|0-19-927945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Collingwood's view, expressed in ''The Principles of Art'', is considered in Wollheim, op. cit. 1980 pp. 36\u201343&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of [[Kant]], and was developed in the early 20th century by [[Roger Fry]] and [[Clive Bell]].  More recently, thinkers influenced by [[Martin Heidegger]] have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Heidegger]], &quot;The Origin of the Work of Art&quot;, in ''Poetry, Language, Thought'', (Harper Perennial, 2001). See also [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], &quot;C\u00e9zanne's Doubt&quot; in ''The Merleau-Ponty Aesthetics Reader'', Galen Johnson and Michael Smith (eds), (Northwestern University Press, 1994) and [[John Russon]], ''Bearing Witness to Epiphany'', (State University of New York Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] has offered an [[institutional theory of art]] that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as &quot;the [[art world]]&quot; has conferred &quot;the status of candidate for appreciation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;W.

New York: St. Martin's Press, 1979, p. 89. {{ISBN|0-312-05391-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Shiner has described fine art as &quot;not an essence or a fate but something we have made.

Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, p.83, pp.75\u2013115 pp.132\u2013141, pp.147\u2013155, p.163, p.627.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Medieval art]] of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of subjects about Biblical and religious culture, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms. Nevertheless, a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works, and realism steadily grew in the art of [[Catholic Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp. 86\u201389, pp. 135\u2013141, p. 143, p. 179, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Renaissance art]] had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it, reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development of a systematic method of [[graphical perspective]] to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nichols2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Nichols|title=Renaissance Art: A Beginner's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzMRpHo0QHUC|date=1 December 2012|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-178-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[File:Tugra Mahmuds II.gif|right|thumb|The stylized signature of [[Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] was written in [[Islamic calligraphy]].

India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance, while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines. China saw the flourishing of many art forms: jade carving, bronzework, pottery (including the stunning [[terracotta army]] of Emperor Qin&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp. 634\u2013635&lt;/ref&gt;), poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc. Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty.

Thus, Japanese woodblock prints (themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development. Later, [[African art|African sculptures]] were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by [[Matisse]].

Works of art are not merely representations of the way things are, but actually produce a community's shared understanding.

Its restrictive interpretation is &quot;socially unhealthy, philosophically unreal, and politically unwise&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belton&quot;/&gt;\n\nFinally, the developing theory of [[post-structuralism]] studies art's significance in a cultural context, such as the ideas, emotions, and reactions prompted by a work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=Melahat K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckarslan |last1=Emiro\u011flu |first2=Fitnat Cim\u015fit |last2=Ko\u015f |title=Design Semiotics and Post-Structuralism |conference=12th World Congress of Semiotics |date=16\u201320 September 2014 |location=New Bulgarian University |url=http://semio2014.org/en/design-semiotics-and-post-structuralism}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural context often reduces to the artist's techniques and intentions, in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism. However, in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate, such as religious and philosophical convictions, sociopolitical and economic structures, or even climate and geography.

Spain, late 10th century]]\nArt has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of Art is &quot;vague&quot;, but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created. Some of these functions of Art are provided in the following outline. The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (L\u00e9vi-Strauss).&lt;ref name=&quot;Schiuma2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Giovanni Schiuma|title=The Value of Arts for Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wyboE8aWDcC|date=19 May 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49665-0|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Non-motivated functions ===\nThe non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schiuma2011&quot; /&gt;\n# '''[[fine arts|Basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm]].''' Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility.&lt;blockquote&gt;Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry. \u2013 Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |title=Republic |chapter=[Book 10:] The Poetics |others=Note: Although speaking mostly of poetry here, the Ancient Greeks often speak of the arts collectively |url=http://www.authorama.com/the-poetics-2.html |website=www.authorama.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n# '''Experience of the mysterious.''' Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry.&lt;blockquote&gt;The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. \u2013 Albert Einstein&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert. &quot;The World as I See It&quot;. http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/essay.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n# '''Expression of the imagination.''' Art provides a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language. Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable.&lt;blockquote&gt;Jupiter's eagle [as an example of art] is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else\u2014something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words. They furnish an aesthetic idea, which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation, but with the proper function, however, of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken. \u2013 Immanuel Kant&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Critique of Aesthetic Judgement'' (1790).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n# '''Ritualistic and symbolic functions.''' In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture. This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture.&lt;blockquote&gt;Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'. \u2013 Silva Tomaskova&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Tomaskova, ''Places of Art: Art and Archaeology in Context'': (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n===Motivated functions ===\nMotivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) sell a product, or simply as a form of communication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schiuma2011&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephanidis2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Constantine Stephanidis|title=HCI International 2011 Posters' Extended Abstracts: International Conference, HCI International 2011, Orlando, FL, USA, July 9\u201314, 2011, Proceedings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qble3WYcH0cC|date=24 June 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-22094-4|pages=529\u2013533}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n# '''Communication.''' Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose. Illustrative arts, such as scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication. Maps are another example. However, the content need not be scientific. Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art.&lt;blockquote&gt;[Art is a set of] artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication. \u2013 Steve Mithen&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mithen. ''The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, Religion and Science''. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n# '''Art as entertainment'''.

This is often the function of the art industries of Motion Pictures and Video Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Resources2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Information Resources Management Association|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1BaXBQAAQBAJ|title=Digital Arts and Entertainment: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications.|date=30 June 2014|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-4666-6115-8|location=USA|page=976}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n# '''The Avant-Garde. Art for political change.''' One of the defining functions of early 20th-century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that had this goal\u2014[[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Russian constructivism]], and [[Abstract Expressionism]], among others\u2014are collectively referred to as the ''avant-garde'' arts.&lt;blockquote&gt;By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life. \u2013 Andr\u00e9 Breton (Surrealism)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tcf.ua.edu/Classes/Jbutler/T340/SurManifesto/ManifestoOfSurrealism.htm Andr\u00e9 Breton, ''Manifesto of Surrealism''  (1924)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n# '''Art as a &quot;free zone&quot;''', removed from the action of the social censure. Unlike the [[avant-garde]] movements, which wanted to erase cultural differences in order to produce new universal values, [[contemporary art]] has enhanced its tolerance towards cultural differences as well as its critical and liberating functions (social inquiry, activism, subversion, deconstruction ...), becoming a more open place for research and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Maurizio Bolognini]] this is not only associated with the [[postmodern art|postmodern]] rejection of all canons but with a process of secularization of art, which is finally considered as &quot;a mere (albeit essential) convention, sustained and reproduced by the art system (artists, galleries, critics, collectors), providing a free zone, that is, a more open place for experimentation, removed from the constraints of the practical sphere.&quot;: see {{Cite book |title=Postdigitale |url=http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm |year=2008 |author=Maurizio Bolognini |publisher=Carocci |location=Rome |isbn=978-88-430-4739-0}}, [http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm#ch3b chap. 3].&lt;/ref&gt;\n# '''Art for social inquiry, subversion or anarchy.''' While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal. In this case, the function of art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society.[[File:Graffiti Panorama rome.jpg|upright=3.2|thumb|center|[[Aerosol paint|Spray-paint]] [[graffiti]] on a wall in Rome]] [[Graffiti#Uses|Graffiti art]] and other types of [[street art]] are graphics and images that are [[Spray painting|spray-painted]] or [[stencil]]led on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission.

The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hogan2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Hogan|title=Healing Arts: The History of Art Therapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzUuna6LPBIC|year=2001|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1-85302-799-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n# '''Art for propaganda, or commercialism.''' Art is often utilized as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Barthes]], ''Mythologies''&lt;/ref&gt;\n# '''Art as a fitness indicator.''' It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment. One [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the human equivalent of the [[peacock]]'s tail. The purpose of the male peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females (see also [[Fisherian runaway]] and [[handicap principle]]). According to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionarily important because it attracted mates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dutton&quot;&gt;[[Denis Dutton|Dutton, Denis]]. 2003. &quot;Aesthetics and Evolutionary Psychology&quot; in ''The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive, as many of them may overlap. For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video game.\n\n==Public access==\n[[File:Cour de Marbre du Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles October 5, 2011.jpg|upright=2|thumb|left|Versailles: [[Louis Le Vau]] opened up the interior court to create the expansive entrance ''[[cour d'honneur]]'', later copied all over Europe.]]\n\nSince ancient times, much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power, often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials.

One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold. It is &quot;necessary to present something more than mere objects&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=An Interview with Joseph Beuys |journal=ArtForum |date=December 1969 |first=Willoughby |last=Sharp |volume=8 |issue=4 |page=45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys. This time period saw the rise of such things as performance art, [[video art]], and [[conceptual art]]. The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was simply an idea, it could not be bought and sold. &quot;Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s.

Many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art. The marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it, and the artwork remains an upper-class activity. &quot;With the widespread use of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s, artists, and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks, gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Jean and Craig McDaniel: ''Themes of Contemporary Art, Visual Art after 1980'', p. 16.

[[Iconoclasm]] is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons, including religious ones. [[Aniconism]] is a general dislike of either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has been a thread in many major religions. It has been a crucial factor in the history of [[Islamic art]], where [[depictions of Muhammad]] remain especially controversial. Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other groups. Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by [[art critic]]s, though often much less so by a wider public. The [[iconography|iconographic]] content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the [[Swoon of the Virgin]] in scenes of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]. [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The ''Last Judgment'']] by [[Michelangelo]] was controversial for various reasons, including breaches of [[decorum]] through nudity and the [[Apollo]]-like pose of Christ.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCue2016&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Maureen McCue|title=British Romanticism and the Reception of Italian Old Master Art, 1793\u20131840|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xW43DAAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-17148-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nickerson2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Angela K.

Strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy. [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'' (c. 1820), was in part a political commentary on a recent event.

[[Andres Serrano]]'s ''[[Piss Christ]]'' (1989) is a photograph of a crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine.

This concern is largely absent in other traditions of art.  The aesthetic theorist [[John Ruskin]], who championed what he saw as the naturalism of [[J. M. W. Turner|J.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W. Turner]], saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;go to nature in all [[singleness of heart]], rejecting nothing and selecting nothing, and scorning nothing, believing all things are right and good, and rejoicing always in the truth&quot;.

London: Smith, Elder and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century. [[Richard Wollheim]] distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art: the [[Aesthetic realism|Realist]], whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view; the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivist]], whereby it is also an absolute value, but is dependent on general human experience; and the [[Relativist]] [[Aesthetic relativism|position]], whereby it is not an absolute value, but depends on, and varies with, the human experience of different humans.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim 1980, ''Essay VI''. pp. 231\u201339.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Arrival of Modernism===\n[[File:Piet Mondriaan, 1930 - Mondrian Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow.jpg|thumb|''[[Composition with Red Blue and Yellow]]'' (1930) by [[Piet Mondrian]] (Dutch, 1872\u20131944)]]\nThe arrival of [[Modernism]] in the late 19th century lead to a radical break in the conception of the function of art,&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Differencing the Canon''.

Francis Frascina and Charles Harrison, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting:\n{{quote|Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; modernism used art to call attention to art. The limitations that constitute the medium of painting\u2014the flat surface, the shape of the support, the properties of the pigment\u2014were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly.

In ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'', Larry Shiner examines the construction of the modern system of the arts, i.e. fine art. He finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system (fine art) held art to be any skilled human activity; for example, Ancient Greek society did not possess the term art, but [[techne]]. Techne can be understood neither as art or craft, the reason being that the distinctions of art and [[craft]] are historical products that came later on in human history.

This resulted in the rise of the [[New Criticism]] school and debate concerning ''the intentional fallacy''. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waugh2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Patricia Waugh|title=Literary Theory and Criticism: An Oxford Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LXMA_7Ko9YC|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929133-5|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colebrook1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Claire Colebrook|title=New Literary Histories: New Historicism and Contemporary Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aT-8AAAAIAAJ|year=1997|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4987-3|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn 1946, [[W.

This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the [[reader-response]] school of literary theory. Ironically, one of the leading theorists from this school, [[Stanley Fish]], was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his 1970 essay &quot;Literature in the Reader.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Vincent B., et al., eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fish|first=Stanley|date=Autumn 1970|title=Literature in the Reader: Affective Stylistics|jstor=468593|journal=New Literary History|volume=2|issue=1|pages=123\u2013162|doi=10.2307/468593}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAs summarized by Gaut and Livingston in their essay &quot;The Creation of Art&quot;: &quot;Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms' assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gaut and Livingston, ''The Creation of Art'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; These authors contend that: &quot;Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaut and Livingston, p.6&quot;&gt;Gaut and Livingston, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nGaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that: &quot;Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works.&quot; They quote [[Richard Wollheim]] as stating that, &quot;The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaut and Livingston, p.6&quot;/&gt;\n\n===&quot;Linguistic turn&quot; and its debate===\nThe end of the 20th century fostered an extensive debate known as the linguistic turn controversy, or the &quot;innocent eye debate&quot;, and generally referred to as the structuralism-[[poststructuralism]] debate in the philosophy of art. This debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophy for Architecture'', Branco Mitrovic, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDecisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the [[structuralism]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and the ensuing movement of [[poststructuralism]]. In 1981, the artist [[Mark Tansey]] created a work of art titled &quot;The Innocent Eye&quot; as a criticism of the prevailing climate of disagreement in the philosophy of art during the closing decades of the 20th century. Influential theorists include [[Judith Butler]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in art history and historical discourse was explored by [[Hayden White]]. The fact that language is ''not'' a transparent medium of thought had been stressed by a very different form of [[philosophy of language]] which originated in the works of [[Johann Georg Hamann]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]].&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Structuralism'', Michael Lane, Basic Books University of Michigan, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Gombrich]] and [[Nelson Goodman]] in his book ''[[Languages of Art]]: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols'' came to hold that the conceptual encounter with the work of art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the work of art during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Languages of Art]]: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols''. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1968. 2nd ed. Indianapolis: Hackett, 1976. Based on his 1960\u201361 [[John Locke lectures]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was challenged on the basis of research done by the Nobel prize winning psychologist [[Roger Sperry]] who maintained that the human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in language alone (the linguistic turn) and that other forms of psychological representations of the work of art were equally defensible and demonstrable. Sperry's view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with aesthetic philosophers such as [[Nick Zangwill]] strongly defending a return to moderate aesthetic formalism among other alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Zangwill, &quot;Feasible Aesthetic Formalism&quot;, ''Nous'', December 1999, pp. 610\u201329.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Classification disputes==\n{{Main|Classificatory disputes about art}}\n[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|The original ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], 1917, photographed by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] at the [[Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession|291]] after the 1917 [[Society of Independent Artists]] exhibit.

Classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included [[cubist]] and [[impressionist]] paintings, [[Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', the movies, superlative imitations of [[J. S. G.

Rather, &quot;the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life&quot; are &quot;so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Novitz|first=David|date=1996|title=Disputes about Art|jstor=431087|journal=The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|volume=54|issue=2|pages=153\u2013163|doi=10.2307/431087|issn=0021-8529}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper. For example, when the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' criticized [[Damien Hirst|Hirst]]'s and [[Tracey Emin|Emin]]'s work by arguing &quot;For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all&quot; they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Colin.

Berg Publishers, 2002. p. 12. {{ISBN|1-85973-661-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Arthur Danto]], suggested a thought experiment showing that &quot;the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities. Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, Denis [http://www.denisdutton.com/tribal_art.htm &quot;Tribal Art&quot;] in ''[[Encyclopedia of Aesthetics]], edited by Michael Kelly (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998).''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danto, Arthur. &quot;Artifact and Art&quot; in ''Art/Artifact'', edited by Susan Vogel.

National Gallery, [[Canberra]], Australia]]\n\nSomewhat in relation to the above, the word ''art'' is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as &quot;that meal was a work of art&quot; (the cook is an artist),&lt;ref name=&quot;Potts2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Joe Potts|title=The Kahuna Kit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uu6lPR6EPQC|year=2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4567-8689-2|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;the art of deception&quot; (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised). It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity. Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism. At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered ''art'' is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive. Though perception is always colored by experience, and is necessarily subjective, it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art. However, &quot;good&quot; art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers. In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic. Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons. For example, [[Francisco Goya]]'s painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3 May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians. Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage. Thus, the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art'.&lt;ref name=&quot;AddisonBurgess2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Addison|author2=Lesley Burgess|title=Debates in Art and Design Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qOY10gcBeP8C|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-61887-8|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FergusonMansbach2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yale H.

Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all seem to agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the ''[[zeitgeist]]''. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse [[aesthetic]] or [[morality|moral]] feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but they do not have to do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the [[human condition]]; that is, what it is to be human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graham |first1=Gordon |title=Philosophy of the arts: an introduction to aesthetics |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; By extension, it has been argued by Emily L.

But long before [[abstraction]]s like ''the number'' arose, there were mathematical concepts to serve the purposes of civilization.{{clarify|date=June 2019 |reason=Referring to math without numbers can confuse people unfamiliar with this subject}} These concepts include [[one-to-one correspondence]] (the basis of counting), comparison to a standard (used for measurement), and the ''3-4-5'' right triangle (a device for assuring a ''right angle'').\n\nThe earliest known tool for use in computation was the [[abacus]], and it was thought to have been invented in [[Babylon]] circa 2400 BC. Its original style of usage was by lines drawn in sand with pebbles. Abaci, of a more modern design, are still used as calculation tools today. This was the first known calculation aid \u2013 preceding Greek methods by 2,000 years{{citation needed|reason=What Greek methods?|date=March 2018}}.\n\nThe first recorded idea of using digital electronics for computing was the 1931 paper &quot;The Use of Thyratrons for High Speed Automatic Counting of Physical Phenomena&quot; by [[C.

The program has an executable form that the computer can use directly to execute the instructions. The same program in its human-readable source code form, enables a programmer to study and develop a sequence of steps known as an algorithm. Because the instructions can be carried out in different types of computers, a single set of source instructions converts to machine instructions according to the CPU type.\n\nThe execution [[process (computing)|process]] carries out the instructions in a computer program. Instructions express the computations performed by the computer. They trigger sequences of simple actions on the executing machine. Those actions produce effects according to the [[Formal semantics of programming languages|semantics]] of the instructions.\n\n=== Computer software and hardware ===\nComputer software, or just &quot;software&quot;, is a collection of computer programs and related [[data]] that provides the instructions for telling a [[computer]] what to do and how to do it. Software refers to one or more computer programs and data held in the storage of the computer for some purposes. In other words, software is a set of ''programs, procedures, algorithms'' and its ''documentation'' concerned with the operation of a data processing system. Program software performs the [[Function (engineering)|function]] of the [[Computer program|program]] it implements, either by directly providing [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] to the computer hardware or by serving as input to another piece of software. The [[Terminology|term]] was coined to contrast with the old term ''[[Computer hardware|hardware]]'' (meaning physical devices). In contrast to hardware, software is intangible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Wordreference.com: WordNet 2.0| publisher = Princeton University, Princeton, NJ| url = http://www.wordreference.com/definition/software\n| accessdate = 2007-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Software is also sometimes used in a more narrow sense, meaning application software only.\n\n==== Application software ====\n{{Main|Application software}}\n\nApplication software, also known as an &quot;application&quot; or an &quot;app&quot;, is a [[computer software]] designed to help the user to perform specific tasks. Examples include [[enterprise software]], [[accounting software]], [[office suite]]s, [[graphics software]] and [[media player (application software)|media player]]s. Many application programs deal principally with [[Document file format|documents]]. Apps may be [[Product bundling|bundled]] with the computer and its system software, or may be published separately. Some users are satisfied with the bundled apps and need never install additional applications.\n\nApplication software is contrasted with [[system software]] and [[middleware]], which manage and integrate a computer's capabilities, but typically do not directly apply them in the performance of tasks that benefit the user. The system software serves the application, which in turn serves the user.\n\nApplication software applies the power of a particular [[computing platform]] or system software to a particular purpose. Some apps such as [[Microsoft Office]] are available in versions for several different platforms; others have narrower requirements and are thus called, for example, a [[Geographic information system|Geography]] application for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] or an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] application for [[Educational software|education]] or [[Linux gaming]]. Sometimes a new and popular application arises that only runs on one platform, increasing the desirability of that platform. This is called a [[killer application]].\n\n====System software====\n{{Main|System software}}\n\nSystem software, or systems software, is computer software designed to operate and control the computer hardware, and to provide a platform for running application software. System software includes [[operating system]]s, [[utility software]], [[device driver]]s, [[window system]]s, and [[firmware]]. Frequently used development tools such as [[compiler]]s, [[linker (computing)|linker]]s, and [[Debugging|debuggers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=system software |last=Rouse|first=Margaret|publisher=TechTarget|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=|website = WhatIs.com|date = March 2019|url = https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/system-software}}&lt;/ref&gt; are classified as system software.\n\n=== Computer network ===\n{{Main|Computer network}}\n\nA computer network, often simply referred to as a network, is a collection of hardware components and computers '''[[Computer network|interconnected]]''' by communication channels that allow sharing of resources and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atis.org/glossary/definition.aspx?id=6555 |title=Computer network definition |accessdate=2011-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121061919/http://www.atis.org/glossary/definition.aspx?id=6555 |archivedate=2012-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where at least one process in one device is able to send/receive data to/from at least one process residing in a remote device, then the two devices are said to be in a network.\n\nNetworks may be classified according to a wide variety of characteristics such as the medium used to transport the data, [[communications protocol]] used, scale, [[Network topology|topology]], and organizational scope.\n\n[[Communications protocol]]s define the rules and data formats for exchanging information in a computer network, and provide the basis for [[computer network programming|network programming]]. Well-known communications protocols include [[Ethernet]], a hardware and [[Link Layer]] standard that is ubiquitous in [[local area network]]s, and the [[Internet Protocol Suite]], which defines a set of protocols for internetworking, i.e. for data communication between multiple networks, as well as host-to-host data transfer, and application-specific data transmission formats.\n\nComputer networking is sometimes considered a sub-discipline of [[electrical engineering]], [[telecommunications]], [[computer science]], [[information technology]] or [[computer engineering]], since it relies upon the theoretical and practical application of these disciplines.\n\n==== Internet ====\n{{main|Internet}}\nThe Internet is a global system of interconnected [[computer network]]s that use the standard [[Internet protocol suite]] (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, of local to global scope, that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of [[information]] resources and services, such as the inter-linked [[hypertext]] documents of the [[World Wide Web]] and the [[information infrastructure|infrastructure]] to support [[email]].\n\n=== Computer programming ===\n{{Main|Computer programming|Software engineering}}\n\nComputer programming in general is the process of writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code and documentation of [[computer program]]s. This source code is written in a [[programming language]], which is an [[artificial language]] often more restrictive or demanding than [[natural language]]s, but easily translated by the computer. The purpose of programming is to invoke the desired behavior (customization) from the machine. The process of writing high quality source code requires knowledge of both the application's domain  ''and'' the computer science domain. The highest-quality software is thus developed by a team of various domain experts, each person a specialist in some area of development. But the term ''programmer'' may apply to a range of program quality, from [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacker]] to [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|open source contributor]] to professional. And a single programmer could do most or all of the computer programming needed to generate the [[proof of concept]] to launch a new [[Killer application|&quot;killer&quot; application]].\n\n==== Computer programmer ====\n{{Main|Programmer|Software engineer|Software developer}}\n\nA programmer, computer programmer, or coder is a person who writes [[computer software]]. The term ''computer programmer'' can refer to a specialist in one area of [[computer programming]] or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software. One who practices or professes a formal approach to programming may also be known as a programmer analyst. A programmer's primary computer language ([[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Python programming language|Python]], etc.) is often prefixed to the above titles, and those who work in a web environment often prefix their titles with ''web''. The term ''programmer'' can be used to refer to a [[software developer]], [[software engineer]], [[computer scientist]], or [[software analyst]]. However, members of these [[profession]]s typically&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://news.codecademy.com/5-skills-developers-need-beyond-writing-code/ |title = 5 Skills Developers Need Beyond Writing Code|date = 23 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; possess other [[software engineering]] skills, beyond programming.\n\n=== Computer industry ===\n{{Main|Computer industry}}\n\nThe computer industry is made up of all of the businesses involved in developing [[computer software]], designing [[computer hardware]] and [[computer networking]] infrastructures, the manufacture of [[computer]] components and the provision of [[information technology]] services including [[System administrator|system administration]] and maintenance.\n\n==== Software industry ====\n{{Main|Software industry}}\n\nThe software industry includes businesses engaged in [[software development|development]], [[software maintenance|maintenance]] and [[software publisher|publication]] of [[software]]. The industry also includes software [[Service (economics)|service]]s, such as [[training]], [[software documentation|documentation]], and [[consultancy|consulting]].\n\n=={{Anchor|DISCIPLINES}}Sub-disciplines of computing==\n\n=== Computer engineering ===\n{{Main|Computer engineering}}\n\nComputer engineering is a [[academic discipline|discipline]] that integrates several fields of [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]] required to develop computer hardware and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author1 = IEEE Computer Society | authorlink = IEEE Computer Society |author2=ACM |authorlink2=Association for Computing Machinery  | title = Computer Engineering 2004: Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computer Engineering | url = http://www.acm.org/education/education/curric_vols/CE-Final-Report.pdf | accessdate = 2012-12-17 |date=12 December 2004 | page = iii | quote = Computer System engineering has traditionally been viewed as a combination ofboth electronic engineering (EE) and computer science (CS).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer engineers usually have training in [[electronic engineering]] (or [[electrical engineering]]), [[software design]], and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual [[microprocessor]]s, [[personal computer]]s, and [[supercomputer]]s, to [[circuit design]]. This field of engineering not only focuses on the design of hardware within its own domain, but as well the interactions between hardware and the world around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web\n | last = Trinity College Dublin | url = http://www.tcd.ie/Engineering/about/what_is_eng/computer_eng_intro.html | title = What is Computer System Engineering | accessdate = 2006-04-21}}, &quot;Computer engineers need not only to understand how computer systems themselves work, but also how they integrate into the larger picture. Consider the car. A modern car contains many separate computer systems for controlling such things as the engine timing, the brakes and the air bags. To be able to design and implement such a car, the computer engineer needs a broad theoretical understanding of all these various subsystems &amp; how they interact.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== Software engineering ===\n{{Main|Software engineering}}\n\nSoftware engineering (SE) is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of [[software]], and the study of these approaches; that is, the application of [[engineering]] to software.&lt;ref name=&quot;BoDu04&quot;&gt;{{cite book|pages =1| first1= Alain| last1=Abran| first2=James W.| last2=Moore| first3=Pierre| last3=Bourque| first4=Robert| last4=Dupuis| first5=Leonard L.| last5=Tripp| title=Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge| year=2004| publisher=IEEE| isbn=978-0-7695-2330-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = ACM | year = 2006 | url = http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=12 | title = Computing Degrees &amp; Careers | publisher = ACM | accessdate = 2010-11-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110617053818/http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=12 | archive-date = 2011-06-17 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Laplante | first = Phillip | title = What Every Engineer Should Know about Software Engineering | publisher = CRC | location = Boca Raton | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-8493-7228-5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pFHYk0KWAEgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=What%20Every%20Engineer%20Should%20Know%20about%20Software%20Engineering.&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage | accessdate = 2011-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In layman's terms, it is the act of using insights to conceive, model and scale a solution to a problem.

Some, such as [[computational complexity theory]], which studies fundamental properties of [[computational problem]]s, are highly abstract, while others, such as [[Computer graphics (computer science)|computer graphics]], emphasize real-world applications. Still others focus on the challenges in implementing computations. For example, [[programming language theory]] studies approaches to description of computations, while the study of [[computer programming]] itself investigates various aspects of the use of [[programming language]]s and [[complex systems]], and [[human\u2013computer interaction]] focuses on the challenges in making computers and computations useful, usable, and universally accessible to [[human]]s.\n\n=== Cybersecurity ===\n{{Main|Computer security}}\n\n=== Data science ===\n{{Main|Data Science}}\n\n=== Information systems ===\n{{Main|Information systems}}\n\n&quot;Information systems (IS)&quot; is the study of complementary networks of hardware and software (see [[information technology]]) that people and organizations use to collect, filter, process, create, and distribute [[data (computing)|data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwmatthes.in.tum.de/wikis/system-cartography/application-landscape|title=Definition of Application Landscape|date=Jan 21, 2009|publisher=Software Engineering for Business Information Systems (sebis)|accessdate=January 14, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305011857/http://wwwmatthes.in.tum.de/wikis/system-cartography/application-landscape|archivedate=March 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Archibald |first=J.A. |date=May 1975 |title=Computer Science education for majors of other disciplines |journal=AFIPS Joint Computer Conferences |pages=903\u2013906 |quote=Computer science spreads out over several related disciplines, and shares with these disciplines certain sub-disciplines that traditionally have been located exclusively in the more conventional disciplines}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Denning |first=Peter |date=July 1999 |title=COMPUTER SCIENCE: THE DISCIPLINE |journal=Encyclopaedia of Computer Science (2000 Edition) |quote=The Domain of Computer Science: Even though computer science addresses both human-made and natural information processes, the main effort in the discipline has been directed toward human-made processes, especially information processing systems and machines}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coy |first=Wolfgang |date=June 2004 |title=Between the disciplines |journal=ACM SIGCSE Bulletin |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=7\u201310 |issn= 0097-8418 |quote=Computer science may be in the core of these processes.

While many have a catalogue of crimes called the [[criminal code]], in some [[Common law (legal system)|common law]] countries no such comprehensive statute exists.\n\nThe state ([[Forms of government|government]]) has the power to severely restrict one's [[liberty]] for committing a crime. In [[Contemporary society|modern societies]], there are [[Criminal procedure|procedures]] to which investigations and [[trial]]s must adhere. If found [[Guilt (law)|guilty]], an offender may be [[Sentence (law)|sentenced]] to a form of reparation such as a [[community sentence]], or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo [[imprisonment]], [[life imprisonment]] or, in some [[jurisdiction]]s, [[Capital punishment|execution]].\n\nUsually, to be classified as a crime, the &quot;act of doing something criminal&quot; (''[[actus reus]]'') must{{snd}}with [[Strict liability|certain exceptions]]{{snd}}be accompanied by the &quot;intention to do something criminal&quot; (''[[mens rea]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;oxdic&quot;/&gt;\n\nWhile every crime violates the law, not every [[violation of the law]] counts as a crime. Breaches of [[private law]] ([[tort]]s and [[breach of contract|breaches of contract]]) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through [[civil procedure]].\n\n== Overview ==\n\nWhen informal relationships prove insufficient to establish and maintain a desired [[social order]], a government or a state may impose more formalized or stricter systems of [[social control]]. With institutional and legal machinery at their disposal, agents of the state can compel [[population]]s to conform to codes and can opt to punish or attempt to reform those who do not conform.\n\nAuthorities employ various mechanisms to regulate (encouraging or discouraging) certain behaviors in general. Governing or administering agencies may for example codify rules into laws, police citizens and visitors to ensure that they comply with those laws, and implement other policies and practices that legislators or administrators have prescribed with the aim of discouraging or [[crime prevention|preventing crime]]. In addition, authorities provide [[Legal remedy|remedies]] and [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]], and collectively these constitute a [[criminal justice]] system. Legal sanctions vary widely in their severity; they may include (for example) incarceration of temporary character aimed at reforming the [[convict]]. Some jurisdictions have penal codes written to inflict permanent harsh punishments: legal [[mutilation]], [[capital punishment]], or [[life imprisonment|life without parole]].\n\nUsually, a [[natural person]] perpetrates a crime, but [[legal personality|legal persons]] may also commit crimes. Historically, several premodern societies believed that non-human [[animal]]s were capable of committing crimes, and prosecuted and punished them accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Girgen|first1=Jen|title=The Historical and Contemporary Prosecution and Punishment of Animals|journal=Animal Law Journal|date=2003|volume=9|pages=97|url=https://law.lclark.edu/live/files/26566-9cgirgen|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe sociologist [[Richard Quinney]] has written about the relationship between society and crime.

It was probably brought to England as Old French {{lang|fro|crimne}} (12th century form of [[French language|Modern French]] ''crime''), from Latin ''crimen'' (in the genitive case: ''criminis''). In Latin, ''crimen'' could have signified any one of the following: &quot;[[Criminal charge|charge]], [[indictment]], [[Criminal accusation|accusation]]; crime, [[fault (legal)|fault]], offense&quot;.\n\nThe word may derive from the Latin ''cernere'' \u2013 &quot;to decide, to sift&quot; (see [[crisis]], mapped on [[Kairos]] and [[Chronos]]). But [[Ernest Klein]] (citing [[Karl Brugmann]]) rejects this and suggests *cri-men, which originally would have meant &quot;cry of distress&quot;. Thomas G. Tucker suggests a root in &quot;[[crying|cry]]&quot; words and refers to English [[plaintiff|plaint]], [[plaintiff]], and so on. The meaning &quot;offense punishable by law&quot; dates from the late 14th century. The Latin word is [[Gloss (annotation)|glossed]] in Old English by ''facen'', also &quot;deceit, fraud, treachery&quot;, [cf. fake]. ''Crime wave'' is first attested in 1893 in [[American English]].\n\n== Definition ==\n\n=== England and Wales ===\n\nWhether a given act or [[Omission (law)|omission]] constitutes a crime does not depend on the nature of that act or omission; it depends on the nature of the legal consequences that may follow it.&lt;ref&gt;''Seaman v Burley'' [1896] 2 QB, per Lord Esher MR at 346&lt;/ref&gt; An act or omission is a crime if it is capable of being followed by what are called [[criminal proceedings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Law, Eleventh Edition 1982, page 3&quot;&gt;[[Glanville Williams]], ''Learning the Law'', Eleventh Edition, Stevens, 1982, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1 of &quot;Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law&quot; (13th Ed by Ormerod) discusses the various proposed definitions of &quot;crime&quot; in more detail.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n'''History'''\n\nThe following definition of ''crime'' was provided by the Prevention of Crimes Act 1871, and applied&lt;ref&gt;The [[Prevention of Crime Act 1908]], section 10(6) and Schedule&lt;/ref&gt; for the purposes of section 10 of the Prevention of Crime Act 1908:\n\n{{Blockquote|The expression &quot;crime&quot; means, in England and Ireland, any [[felony]] or the offence of [[uttering]] false or counterfeit coin, or of possessing counterfeit gold or silver coin, or the offence of obtaining goods or money by [[false pretences]], or the offence of [[conspiracy to defraud]], or any [[misdemeanour]] under the fifty-eighth section of the [[Larceny Act 1861|Larceny Act, 1861]].}}\n\n=== Scotland ===\n\nFor the purpose of section 243 of the [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]], a crime means an offence punishable on [[indictment]], or an offence punishable on [[summary conviction]], and for the commission of which the offender is liable under the [[statute]] making the offence punishable to be imprisoned either absolutely or at the discretion of the court as an alternative for some other punishment.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/52/section/243 section 243(2)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111200051/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/52/section/243 |date=2012-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== Sociology ===\n\nA [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] [[definition]] views crime as [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]] that violates prevailing [[norm (sociology)|norms]]{{spaced ndash}}[[culture|cultural]] standards prescribing how humans ought to behave normally. This approach considers the complex realities surrounding the concept of crime and seeks to understand how changing [[society|social]], [[politics|political]], [[psychology|psychological]], and [[economics|economic]] conditions may affect changing definitions of crime and the form of the legal, [[Police|law-enforcement]], and penal responses made by society.\n\nThese [[structuralism|structural]] realities remain fluid and often contentious. For example: as cultures change and the political environment shifts, societies may [[criminalisation|criminalise]] or [[decriminalisation|decriminalise]] certain behaviours, which directly affects the [[statistics|statistical]] [[crime rate]]s, influence the allocation of resources for the enforcement of laws, and (re-)influence the general [[public opinion]].\n\nSimilarly, changes in the collection and/or calculation of data on crime may affect the public perceptions of the extent of any given &quot;crime problem&quot;. All such adjustments to [[crime statistics]], allied with the experience of people in their everyday lives, shape attitudes on the extent to which the state should use law or [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] to enforce or encourage any particular [[social norm]]. Behaviour can be controlled and influenced by a society in many ways without having to resort to the criminal justice system.\n\nIndeed, in those cases where no clear [[consensus]] exists on a given norm, the drafting of [[criminal law]] by the group in [[power (sociology)|power]] to prohibit the behaviour of another group may seem to some observers an improper limitation of the second group's [[Political freedom|freedom]], and the ordinary members of society have less respect for the law or laws in general{{snd}}whether the authorities actually enforce the disputed law or not.\n\n=== Other definitions ===\n\n[[Legislature]]s can pass laws (called [[Malum prohibitum|''mala prohibita'']]) that define crimes against social norms. These laws vary from time to time and from place to place: note variations in [[gambling]] laws, for example, and the prohibition or encouragement of [[duelling]] in history. Other crimes, called [[Malum in se|''mala in se'']], count as outlawed in almost all societies, ([[murder]], [[theft]] and [[rape]], for example).\n\n[[English criminal law]] and the related criminal law of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries can define offences that the courts alone have developed over the years, without any actual legislation: [[common law offence]]s. The courts used the concept of ''[[malum in se]]'' to develop various common law offences.&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Law Dictionary'', John A. Yogis, Q.C., Barrons: 2003\n&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n== Criminalization ==\n{{Main| Criminalization}}\n[[File:Traitors heads on old london bridge.jpg|thumb|The spiked heads of executed criminals once adorned the gatehouse of the medieval [[London Bridge]].]]\nOne can view criminalization as a procedure deployed by society as a preemptive harm-reduction device, using the threat of punishment as a [[Deterrence (legal)|deterrent]] to anyone proposing to engage in the behavior causing harm. The state becomes involved because governing entities can become convinced that the costs of not criminalizing (through allowing the harms to continue unabated) outweigh the costs of criminalizing it (restricting individual liberty, for example, to minimize harm to others).{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}\n\nStates control the process of criminalization because:\n* Even if [[victimology|victims]] recognize their own role as victims, they may not have the resources to investigate and seek legal redress for the injuries suffered: the enforcers formally appointed by the state often have better access to expertise and resources.\n* The victims may only want compensation for the injuries suffered, while remaining indifferent to a possible desire for [[deterrence (psychology)|deterrence]].&lt;ref&gt;See Polinsky &amp; Shavell (1997) on the fundamental divergence between the private and the social motivation for using the legal system.&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Fear of [[retaliate|retaliation]] may deter victims or witnesses of crimes from taking any action. Even in policed societies, fear may inhibit from reporting incidents or from co-operating in a [[Trial (law)|trial]].\n* Victims, on their own, may lack the economies of scale that could allow them to administer a penal system, let alone to collect any fines levied by a court.&lt;ref&gt;See Polinsky (1980) on the enforcement of fines&lt;/ref&gt; Garoupa and Klerman (2002) warn that a [[rent-seeking]] government has as its primary motivation to maximize revenue and so, if offenders have sufficient wealth, a rent-seeking government will act more aggressively than a [[social welfare function|social-welfare]]-maximizing government in enforcing laws against minor crimes (usually with a fixed penalty such as parking and routine traffic violations), but more laxly in enforcing laws against major crimes.\n* As a result of the crime, victims may die or become incapacitated.\n\n== Labelling theory ==\n{{further|Labeling theory#The &quot;criminal&quot;}}\n\nThe [[Labeling theory|label]] of &quot;crime&quot; and the accompanying [[social stigma]] normally confine their scope to those activities seen as injurious to the general population or to the state, including some that cause serious loss or damage to individuals. Those who apply the labels of &quot;crime&quot; or &quot;criminal&quot; intend to assert the [[hegemony]] of a dominant population, or to reflect a consensus of condemnation for the identified behavior and to justify any punishments prescribed by the state (in the event that [[due process|standard processing]] [[trial (law)|tries]] and [[conviction (law)|convicts]] an accused person of a crime).\n\n== Natural-law theory ==\n\nJustifying the state's use of [[coercion|force]] to coerce compliance with its laws has proven a consistent theoretical problem. One of the earliest justifications involved the theory of [[natural law]]. This posits that the nature of the world or of human beings underlies the standards of [[morality]] or constructs them. [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote in the 13th century: &quot;the rule and measure of human acts is the [[reason]], which is the first principle of human acts&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On law, morality, and politics|last=Thomas, Aquinas, Saint, 1225?-1274.|date=2002|publisher=Hackett Pub|others=Regan, Richard J., Baumgarth, William P.|isbn=0872206637|edition= 2nd|location=Indianapolis|oclc=50423002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He regarded people as by nature [[rationality|rational]] beings, concluding that it becomes morally appropriate that they should behave in a way that conforms to their rational nature. Thus, to be valid, any law must conform to natural law and coercing people to conform to that law is morally acceptable. In the 1760s, [[William Blackstone]] described the thesis:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Commentaries on the laws of England|last=Blackstone, William, 1723-1780.|date=1979|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=William Blackstone Collection (Library of Congress)|isbn=0226055361|location=Chicago|page=41|oclc=4832359}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n: &quot;This law of nature, being co-eval with mankind and dictated by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe, in all countries, and at all times: no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this original.&quot;\n\nBut [[John Austin (legal philosophy)|John Austin]] (1790\u20131859), an early [[Legal positivism|positivist]], applied [[utilitarianism]] in accepting the calculating nature of human beings and the existence of an objective morality. He denied that the legal validity of a norm depends on whether its content conforms to morality. Thus in Austinian terms, a moral code can objectively determine what people ought to do, the law can embody whatever norms the legislature decrees to achieve social utility, but every individual remains free to choose what to do. Similarly, [[H. L. A. Hart|H.L.A. Hart]] saw the law as an aspect of [[sovereignty]], with lawmakers able to adopt any law as a means to a moral end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The concept of law|last=Hart, H. L. A.

[[Ronald Dworkin]] rejects Hart's theory and proposes that all individuals should expect the equal respect and concern of those who govern them as a fundamental political right. He offers a theory of compliance overlaid by a theory of [[deference]] (the citizen's duty to obey the law) and a theory of enforcement, which identifies the legitimate goals of enforcement and punishment. Legislation must conform to a theory of legitimacy, which describes the circumstances under which a particular person or group is entitled to make law, and a theory of legislative justice, which describes the law they are entitled or obliged to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/takingrightsseri00dwor|title=Taking rights seriously : [with a new appendix, a response to critics]|last=Dworkin, Ronald.|date=1978|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674867114|location=Cambridge|oclc=4313351|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThere are natural-law theorists who have accepted the idea of enforcing the prevailing morality as a primary function of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/natural-law-theories/|first=John|last=Finnis|department=3.2 Natural law &amp; (purely) positive law as concurrent dimensions of legal reasoning|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|OUP]]|isbn=978-0199599141|title=Natural Law &amp; Natural Rights|year=2015|accessdate=2019-07-17|quote=The moral standards...which Dworkin (in line with natural law theory) treats as capable of being morally objective &amp; true, thus function as a direct source of law and...as already law, except when their fit with the whole set of social-fact sources in the relevant community is so weak that it would be more accurate (according to Dworkin) to say that judges who apply them are applying morality not law.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view entails the problem that it makes any moral criticism of the law impossible: if conformity with natural law forms a necessary condition for legal validity, all valid law must, by definition, count as morally just. Thus, on this line of reasoning, the legal validity of a norm necessarily entails its moral justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bix|first=Brian H.|title=Kelsen, Hart, &amp; legal normativity|date=August 2015|journal=Revus - OpenEdition Journals|doi=10.4000/revus.3984|volume=34|issue=34|department=3.3 Law and morality|quote=...it was part of the task of a legal theorist to explain the 'normativity' or 'authority' of law, by which they meant 'our sense that \u2018legal\u2019 norms provide agents with special reasons for acting, reasons they would not have if the norm were not a \u2018legal\u2019 one'...this may be a matter calling more for a psychological or sociological explanation, rather than a philosophical one.|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOne can solve this problem by granting some degree of [[moral relativism]] and accepting that norms may evolve over time and, therefore, one can criticize the continued enforcement of old laws in the light of the current norms. People may find such law acceptable, but the use of state power to coerce citizens to comply with that law lacks moral justification. More recent conceptions of the theory characterise crime as the violation of [[individual and group rights|individual rights]].\n\nSince society considers so many rights as natural (hence the term ''[[rights|right]]'') rather than man-made, what constitutes a crime also counts as natural, in contrast to laws (seen as man-made). [[Adam Smith]] illustrates this view, saying that a [[smuggling|smuggler]] would be an excellent citizen, &quot;...had not the laws of his country made that a crime which nature never meant to be so.&quot;\n\nNatural-law theory therefore distinguishes between &quot;criminality&quot; (which derives from human nature) and &quot;illegality&quot; (which originates with the interests of those in [[power (sociology)|power]]). Lawyers sometimes express the two concepts with the phrases ''[[malum in se]]'' and ''[[malum prohibitum]]'' respectively. They regard a &quot;crime ''malum in se''&quot; as inherently criminal; whereas a &quot;crime ''malum prohibitum''&quot; (the argument goes) counts as criminal only because the law has decreed it so.\n\nIt follows from this view that one can perform an illegal act without committing a crime, while a criminal act could be perfectly legal. Many [[age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers (such as Adam Smith and the American [[List of national founders|Founding Fathers]]) subscribed to this view to some extent, and it remains influential among so-called [[Liberalism#Classical and modern|classical liberals]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n== History ==\nSome religious communities regard [[sin]] as a crime; some may even highlight the crime of sin very early in legendary or mythological accounts of origins{{snd}}note the tale of [[Adam and Eve]] and the theory of [[original sin]]. What one group considers a crime may cause or ignite war or conflict. However, the earliest known [[civilization]]s had codes of [[law]], containing both [[civil law (common law)|civil]] and penal rules mixed together, though not always in recorded form.\n\n=== Ancient Near East ===\nThe [[Sumer]]ians produced the earliest surviving written codes.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Urukagina]] (reigned {{Circa|2380 BC|2360 BC}}, [[short chronology timeline|short chronology]]) had an early code that has not survived; a later king, [[Ur-Nammu]], left the earliest extant written law system, the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]] ({{c.|lk=no|2100|2050 BC}}), which prescribed a formal system of penalties for specific cases in 57 articles. The Sumerians later issued other codes, including the &quot;code of [[Lipit-Ishtar]]&quot;. This code, from the 20th century BCE, contains some fifty articles, and scholars have reconstructed it by comparing several sources. {{quote|The Sumerian was deeply conscious of his personal rights and resented any encroachment on them, whether by his King, his superior, or his equal.

Similarly, the consolidated [[Germanic law|Teutonic laws]] of the [[Germanic tribes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The principle of the personality of law in the Germanic kingdoms of western Europe from the fifth to the eleventh century|last=Guterman, Simeon L.

All the earliest English criminal trials involved wholly extraordinary and arbitrary courts without any settled law to apply, whereas the civil (delictual) law operated in a highly developed and consistent manner (except where a king wanted to raise money by selling a new form of [[writ]]). The development of the idea that the &quot;state&quot; dispenses [[justice]] in a court only emerges in parallel with or after the emergence of the concept of [[sovereignty]].\n\nIn continental Europe, Roman law persisted, but with a stronger influence from the Christian Church.&lt;ref&gt;Vinogradoff (1909); Tierney: 1964, 1979\n&lt;/ref&gt;\nCoupled with the more diffuse political structure based on smaller feudal units, various legal traditions emerged, remaining more strongly rooted in Roman [[jurisprudence]], but modified to meet the prevailing [[political climate]].\n\nIn Scandinavia the effect of Roman law did not become apparent until the 17th century, and the courts grew out of the ''[[thing (assembly)|things]]''{{snd}}the assemblies of the people. The people decided the cases (usually with largest freeholders dominating). This system later gradually developed into a system with a royal judge nominating a number of the most esteemed men of the parish as his board, fulfilling the function of &quot;the people&quot; of yore.\n\nFrom the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] system onwards, the policy rationale for requiring the payment of monetary compensation for wrongs committed has involved the avoidance of [[feud]]ing between [[clan]]s and [[family|families]].&lt;ref&gt;\nThe concept of the ''pater familias'' acted as a unifying factor in extended kin groups, and the later practice of ''[[weregild|wergild]]'' functioned in this context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n&lt;/ref&gt;\nIf compensation could mollify families' feelings, this would help to keep the peace. On the other hand, the institution of oaths also played down the threat of [[endemic warfare|feudal warfare]]. Both in archaic Greece and in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Scandinavia]], an accused person walked free if he could get a sufficient number of male relatives to swear him not guilty. (Compare the [[United Nations Security Council]], in which the [[veto]] power of the permanent members ensures that the organization does not become involved in crises where it could not enforce its decisions.)\n\nThese means of restraining private [[feud]]s did not always work, and sometimes prevented the fulfillment of justice. But in the earliest times the &quot;state&quot; did not always provide an independent policing force. Thus criminal law grew out of what 21st-century lawyers would call torts; and, in real terms, many acts and omissions classified as crimes actually overlap with civil-law concepts.\n\nThe development of [[sociology|sociological]] thought from the 19th century onwards prompted some fresh views on crime and criminality, and fostered the beginnings of [[criminology]] as a study of crime in society. [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] noted a link between crime and [[creativity]]{{spaced ndash}}in ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' he asserted&lt;!-- in what context? --&gt;:{{Context inline|date=November 2016}} &quot;The best and brightest that man can acquire he must obtain by crime&quot;. In the 20th century, [[Michel Foucault]] in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' made a study of [[criminalization]] as a coercive method of state control.\n\n== Classification and categorisation ==\n\n=== Categorisation by type ===\n\nThe following classes of offences are used, or have been used, as legal terms:\n* [[Offence against the person]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;For example, by the [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n* [[Violent crime|Violent offence]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;For example, by section 31(1) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1991]], and by the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n* [[Sex and the law|Sexual offence]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;\n* [[Property crime|Offence against property]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;\n\nResearchers and commentators have classified crimes into the following categories, in addition to those above:\n* [[Forgery]], [[personation]] and [[cheating (law)|cheating]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 22&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Firearms and offensive weapons&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 24&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Offences against the state/offences against the Crown and Government,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 25&lt;/ref&gt; or political offences&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Card, Cross and Jones: Criminal Law]]'', 12th ed, 1992, chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt;\n* [[Drug-related crime|Harmful or dangerous drugs]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 26&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Offences against [[religion]] and public worship&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 27&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Offences against public justice,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 28&lt;/ref&gt; or offences against the administration of public justice&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Card, Cross and Jones: Criminal Law]]'', 12th ed, 1992, chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;\n* [[Public-order crime|Public order offence]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 29&lt;/ref&gt;\n* [[Corporate crime|Commerce]], [[financial market]]s and [[insolvency]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 30&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Offences against [[public morality|public morals]] and [[public policy]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 31&lt;/ref&gt;\n* [[Traffic code|Motor vehicle offences]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 32&lt;/ref&gt;\n* [[Conspiracy (criminal)|Conspiracy]], [[incitement]] and [[attempt]] to commit crime&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 33&lt;/ref&gt;\n* [[Inchoate offense|Inchoate offence]]\n* [[Juvenile delinquency]]\n* [[Victimless crime]]\n\n=== Categorisation by penalty ===\n\nOne can categorise crimes depending on the related punishment, with [[sentence (law)|sentencing]] [[tariff]]s prescribed in line with the perceived seriousness of the offence. Thus [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] and noncustodial sentences may address the crimes seen as least serious, with lengthy imprisonment or (in some jurisdictions) [[capital punishment]] reserved for the most serious.\n\n=== Common law ===\n\nUnder the common law of England, crimes were classified as either [[treason]], [[felony]] or [[misdemeanour]], with treason sometimes being included with the felonies. This system was based on the perceived seriousness of the offence. It is still used in the United States but the distinction between felony and misdemeanour is abolished in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\n=== Classification by mode of trial ===\n\nThe following classes of offence are based on [[mode of trial]]:\n* [[Indictable-only offence]]\n* [[Indictable offence]]\n* [[Hybrid offence]], a.k.a. either-way offence in England and Wales\n* [[Summary offence]], a.k.a. [[summary offence|infraction]] in the US\n\n=== Classification by origin ===\n\nIn common law countries, crimes may be categorised into [[common law offences]] and [[statutory]] offences. In the US, Australia and Canada (in particular), they are divided into [[federal crime]]s and under state crimes.\n\n=== Other classifications ===\n* [[Arrestable offence]]\n\n=== U.S. classification ===\n[[File:Felony Sentences in State Courts.pdf|thumb|''Felony Sentences in State Courts'', study by the [[United States Department of Justice]].]]\nIn the United States since 1930, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has tabulated [[Uniform Crime Reports]] (UCR) annually from crime data submitted by [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] agencies across the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm |title=FBI: Uniform Crime Reports |publisher=Fbi.gov |accessdate=2013-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041024015252/https://www.fbi.gov//ucr/ucr.htm |archivedate=2004-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;\nOfficials compile this data at the city, county, and [[U.S. state|state]] levels into the UCR. They classify violations of laws based on [[common law]] as Part I (index) crimes in UCR data. These are further categorized as violent or property crimes. Part I violent crimes include murder and criminal homicide (voluntary manslaughter), forcible rape, aggravated assault, and robbery; while Part I property crimes include burglary, arson, larceny/theft, and motor-vehicle theft. All other crimes count come under Part II.\n\nFor convenience, such lists usually include [[summary offense|infractions]] although, in the U.S., they may come into the sphere not of the criminal law, but rather of the [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]]. Compare [[tort]]feasance.\n\nBooking [[arrest]]s require detention for a time-frame ranging 1 to 24 hours.\n\n==Reports, studies and organizations==\nThere are several national and International organizations offering studies and statistics about global and local crime activity, such as [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], the United States of America Overseas Security Advisory Council ([[OSAC]]) safety report or national reports generated by the law-enforcement authorities of EU state member reported to the [[Europol]].\n\n== Offence in common law jurisdictions ==\n\nIn England and Wales, as well as in Hong Kong, the term ''offence'' means the same thing as, and is interchangeable with, the term ''[[#England and Wales|crime]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Law, Eleventh Edition 1982, page 3&quot;/&gt; They are further split into:\n* [[Summary offence]]s\n* [[Indictable offence]]s\n\n== Causes and correlates of crime ==\n{{main|Causes and correlates of crime}}\n\nMany different [[correlates of crime|causes and correlates of crime]] have been proposed with varying degree of empirical support. They include socioeconomic, psychological, biological, and behavioral factors. Controversial topics include [[media violence research]] and effects of [[gun politics]].\n\nEmotional state (both chronic and current) have a tremendous impact on individual thought processes and, as a result, can be linked to criminal activities. The positive psychology concept of Broaden and Build posits that cognitive functioning expands when an individual is in a good-feeling emotional state and contracts as emotional state declines.&lt;ref&gt;Fredrickson, B.L. (2005). Positive Emotions broaden the scope of attention and though-action repertoires. Cognition and Emotion, 19: 313\u2013332.&lt;/ref&gt; In positive emotional states an individual is able to consider more possible solutions to problems, but in lower emotional states fewer solutions can be ascertained. The narrowed thought-action repertoires can result in the only paths perceptible to an individual being ones they would never use if they saw an alternative, but if they can't conceive of the alternatives that carry less risk they will choose one that they can see. Criminals who commit even the most horrendous of crimes, such as mass murders, did not see another solution.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R.F. (2012).

More chaos can be seen in the background, including a man with a raised sword and riding a horse towards the foreground.|[[Religious]] sentiment often becomes a contributory factor of crime. In the 1819 anti-Jewish riots in Frankfurt, rioters attacked Jewish businesses and destroyed property.]]\n\nDifferent religious traditions may promote distinct norms of behaviour, and these in turn may clash or harmonise with the perceived interests of a state. Socially accepted or imposed religious morality has influenced secular jurisdictions on issues that may otherwise concern only an individual's conscience. Activities sometimes criminalized on religious grounds include (for example) [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] consumption ([[prohibition]]), [[abortion]] and [[stem cell|stem-cell]] research. In various historical and present-day societies, institutionalized religions have established systems of earthly justice that punish crimes against the divine will and against specific devotional, organizational and other rules under specific codes, such as Roman Catholic [[canon law]].\n\n== Military jurisdictions and states of emergency ==\n\nIn the [[military]] sphere, authorities can prosecute both regular crimes and specific acts (such as [[mutiny]] or [[desertion]]) under [[martial law|martial-law]] codes that either supplant or extend civil codes in times of (for example) war.\n\nMany constitutions contain provisions to curtail freedoms and criminalize otherwise tolerated behaviors under a [[state of emergency]] in the event of war, natural disaster or civil unrest. Undesired activities at such times may include [[Freedom of assembly|assembly]] in the streets, violation of [[curfew]], or [[Gun politics|possession of firearms]].\n\n== Employee crime ==\n{{Main| Occupational crime}}\n\nTwo common types of [[employment|employee]] crime exist: [[embezzlement]] and [[wage theft]].\n\nThe complexity and anonymity of computer systems may help criminal employees camouflage their operations.

Most classical forms are centred upon dance alone, but performance dance may also appear in [[opera]] and other forms of [[musical theatre]].\n\nParticipatory dance, on the other hand, whether it be a [[folk dance]], a [[social dance]], a [[group dance]] such as a [[Line dance|line]], [[Circle dance|circle]], [[Medieval dance#Other Chain Dances|chain]] or [[square dance]], or a [[partner dance]] such as is common in western [[Ballroom dance|Western ballroom dancing]], is undertaken primarily for a common purpose, such as [[social interaction]] or [[exercise]], of participants rather than onlookers. Such dance seldom has any narrative. A group dance and a ''[[corps de ballet]]'', a social partner dance and a ''[[pas de deux]]'', differ profoundly. Even a [[solo dance]] may be undertaken solely for the satisfaction of the dancer. Participatory dancers often all employ the same movements and steps but, for example, in the [[rave culture]] of [[electronic dance music]], vast crowds may engage in [[free dance]], uncoordinated with those around them. On the other hand, some cultures lay down strict rules as to the particular dances in which, for example, men, women and children may or must participate.\n\n==Origins==\n{{Main|History of Dance}}\n[[File:Dancing painting at Bhimbetka.jpg|thumb|left|Mesolithic dancers at Bhimbetka]]\n\n[[archeology|Archeological]] evidence for early dance includes 9,000-year-old paintings in [[India]] at the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tomb paintings depicting dancing figures, dated c. 3300 BC.

[[Bharata Muni]]'s ''[[Natyashastra]]'' (literally ''&quot;the text of dramaturgy&quot;'') is one of the earlier texts. It mainly deals with drama, in which dance plays an important part in Indian culture. It categorizes dance into four types \u2013 secular, ritual, abstract, and, interpretive \u2013 and into four regional varieties. The text elaborates various hand-gestures (''[[mudras]]'') and classifies movements of the various limbs, steps and so on. A strong continuous tradition of dance has since continued in India, through to modern times, where it continues to play a role in culture, ritual, and, notably, the [[Bollywood]] entertainment industry. Many other [[contemporary dance]] forms can likewise be traced back to [[Historical dance|historical]], [[Traditional dance|traditional]], [[Ceremonial dance|ceremonial]], and [[List of dances sorted by ethnicity|ethnic]] dance.\n\n==Dance and music==\n{{main|Dance music}}\n[[File:Dancing girls in concert.jpg|thumb|right|Dancing girls in pop-concert, Sofia, Bulgaria.]]\nDance is generally, though not exclusively, performed with the accompaniment of music and may or may not be performed ''in [[time signature|time]]'' to such music. Some dance (such as [[tap dance]]) may provide its own audible accompaniment in place of (or in addition to) music. Many early forms of music and dance were created for each other and are frequently performed together. Notable examples of traditional dance/music couplings include the [[jig]], [[waltz]], [[Tango music|tango]], [[disco]], and [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]]. Some [[musical genre]]s have a parallel dance form such as [[baroque music]] and [[baroque dance]]; other varieties of dance and music may share nomenclature but developed separately, such as [[Classical music era|classical music]] and [[classical ballet]].\n\n== Dance and rhythm ==\n[[Rhythm]] and dance are deeply linked in history and practice. The American dancer [[Ted Shawn]] wrote; &quot;The conception of rhythm which underlies all studies of the dance is something about which we could talk forever, and still not finish.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shawn 50&quot;&gt;Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; A musical rhythm requires two main elements; first, a regularly-repeating [[pulse (music)|pulse]] (also called the &quot;beat&quot; or &quot;tactus&quot;) that establishes the [[tempo]] and, second, a pattern of [[Accent (music)|accents]] and [[Rest (music)|rests]] that establishes the character of the [[Meter (music)|metre or basic rhythmic pattern]]. The basic pulse is roughly equal in duration to a simple step or gesture.\n[[File:Tango rhythm.svg|thumb|A basic tango rhythm]]\nDances generally have a characteristic tempo and rhythmic pattern. The tango, for example, is usually danced in {{music|time|2|4}} time at approximately 66 beats per minute. The basic slow step, called a &quot;slow&quot;, lasts for one beat, so that a full &quot;right\u2013left&quot; step is equal to one {{music|time|2|4}} measure. The basic forward and backward walk of the dance is so counted \u2013 &quot;slow-slow&quot; \u2013 while many additional figures are counted &quot;slow \u2013 quick-quick.&lt;ref&gt;Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing, ''Ballroom Dancing'', Teach Yourself Books, Hodder and Stoughton, 1977, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nJust as musical rhythms are defined by a pattern of strong and weak beats, so repetitive body movements often depends on alternating &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; muscular movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirstein 4&quot;&gt;Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Given this alternation of left-right, of forward-backward and rise-fall, along with the [[Symmetry in biology|bilateral symmetry]] of the human body, it is natural that many dances and much music are in [[duple and quadruple meter]]. However, since some such movements require more time in one phase than the other \u2013 such as the longer time required to lift a hammer than to strike \u2013 some dance rhythms fall equally naturally into [[triple metre]].&lt;ref&gt;Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, as in [[Music of Southeastern Europe|the folk dances of the Balkans]], dance traditions depend heavily on more complex rhythms. Further, complex dances composed of a fixed sequence of steps always require phrases and melodies of a certain fixed length to accompany that sequence.\n\n[[File:Lululaund - The Dancing Girl (painting and silk cloth. A.L. Baldry 1901, before p.107).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|''Lululaund \u2013 The Dancing Girl'' (painting and silk cloth. A.L. Baldry 1901, before p. 107), The inscription reads; &quot;Dancing is a form of rhythm/ Rhythm is a form of music/ Music is a form of thought/ And thought is a form of divinity.&quot;]]\nThe very act of dancing, the steps themselves, generate an &quot;initial skeleton of rhythmic beats&quot; that must have preceded any separate musical accompaniment, while dance itself, as much as music, requires time-keeping&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; just as utilitarian repetitive movements such as walking, hauling and digging take on, as they become refined, something of the quality of dance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirstein 4&quot;/&gt;\n\nMusical accompaniment therefore arose in the earliest dance, so that ancient Egyptians attributed the origin of the dance to the divine Athotus, who was said to have observed that music accompanying religious rituals caused participants to move rhythmically and to have brought these movements into proportional measure. The same idea, that dance arises from musical rhythm, is still found in [[renaissance]] Europe in the works of the dancing master [[Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro]] who speaks of dance as a physical movement that arises from and expresses inward, spiritual motion agreeing with the &quot;measures and perfect concords of harmony&quot; that fall upon the human ear,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirstein 4&quot;/&gt; while, earlier, [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]], seizing upon dance as a symbol of the holy life foreshadowed in Jesus' saying &quot;I have piped and ye have not danced&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 11:17&lt;/ref&gt; writes;\n\n{{quote|I can not dance unless thou leadest. If thou wouldst have me spring aloft, sing thou and I will spring, into love and from love to knowledge and from knowledge to ecstasy above all human sense&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;}}\n\n[[Thoinot Arbeau]]'s celebrated 16th century dance-treatise ''Orch\u00e9sographie'', indeed, begins with definitions of over eighty distinct drum-rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Dancing with Helen Moller; her own statement of her philosophy and practice and teaching formed upon the classic Greek model, and adapted to meet the aesthetic and hygienic needs of to-day, with (14784705065).jpg|thumb|right|Helen Moller]]\nAs has been shown above, dance has been represented through the ages as having emerged as a response to music yet, as [[Lincoln Kirstein]] implied, it is at least as likely that primitive music arose from dance. Shawn concurs, stating that dance &quot;was the first art of the human race, and the matrix out of which all other arts grew&quot; and that even the &quot;[[Meter (poetry)|metre]] in our poetry today is a result of the accents necessitated by body movement, as the dancing and reciting were performed simultaneously&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shawn 50&quot;/&gt; \u2013 an assertion somewhat supported by the common use of the term &quot;foot&quot; to describe the fundamental rhythmic units of poetry.\n\n[[Percy Scholes|Scholes]], not a dancer but a musician, offers support for this view, stating that the steady measures of music, of two, three or four beats to the bar, its equal and balanced phrases, regular cadences, contrasts and repetitions, may all be attributed to the &quot;incalculable&quot; influence of dance upon music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholes |first=Percy A. |authorlink1= Percy Scholes |title= The Oxford Companion to Music |edition= 10 |year= 1977 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= |chapter=Dance |ref= CITEREFScholes1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[\u00c9mile Jaques-Dalcroze]], primarily a musician and teacher, relates how a study of the physical movements of pianists led him &quot;to the discovery that musical sensations of a rhythmic nature call for the muscular and nervous response of the whole organism&quot;, to develop &quot;a special training designed to regulate nervous reactions and effect a co-ordination of muscles and nerves&quot; and ultimately to seek the connections between &quot;the art of music and the art of dance&quot;, which he formulated into his system of [[Dalcroze Eurhythmics|eurhythmics]].&lt;ref&gt;\u00c9mile Jaques-Dalcroze, ''Rhythm, Music and Education'', 1973, The Dalcroze Society, London, p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that &quot;musical rhythm is only the transposition into sound of movements and dynamisms spontaneously and involuntarily expressing emotion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;\u00c9mile Jaques-Dalcroze, ''Rhythm, Music and Education'', 1973, The Dalcroze Society, London, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHence, though doubtless, as Shawn asserts, &quot;it is quite possible to develop the dance without music and... music is perfectly capable of standing on its own feet without any assistance from the dance&quot;, nevertheless the &quot;two arts will always be related and the relationship can be profitable both to the dance and to music&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; the precedence of one art over the other being a moot point. The [[Common metre|common ballad measures]] of hymns and folk-songs takes their name from dance, as does the [[Carol (music)|carol]], originally a [[circle dance]]. Many purely musical pieces have been named &quot;[[waltz]]&quot; or &quot;[[minuet]]&quot;, for example, while many [[concert dance]]s have been produced that are based upon abstract musical pieces, such as ''[[2 and 3 Part Inventions]], [[Adams Violin Concerto]]'' and ''[[Andantino (ballet)|Andantino]]''. Similarly, poems are often structured and named after dances or musical works, while dance and music have both drawn their conception of &quot;measure&quot; or &quot;metre&quot; from poetry.\n\nShawn quotes with approval the statement of Dalcroze that, while the art of musical rhythm consists in differentiating and combining time durations, pauses and accents &quot;according to physiological law&quot;, that of &quot;plastic rhythm&quot; (i.e. dance) &quot;is to designate movement in space, to interpret long time-values by slow movements and short ones by quick movements, regulate pauses by their divers successions and express sound accentuations in their multiple nuances by additions of bodily weight, by means of muscular innervations&quot;.\n\nShawn nevertheless points out that the system of musical time is a &quot;man-made, artificial thing.... a manufactured tool, whereas rhythm is something that has always existed and depends on man not at all&quot;, being &quot;the continuous flowing time which our human minds cut up into convenient units&quot;, suggesting that music might be revivified by a return to the values and the time-perception of dancing.&lt;ref&gt;Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, pp. 50\u201351&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe early-20th-century American dancer Helen Moller stated simply that &quot;it is rhythm and form more than harmony and color which, from the beginning, has bound music, poetry and dancing together in a union that is indissoluble.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Moller, Helen and Dunham, Curtis, ''Dancing with Helen Moller'', 1918, John Lane (New York and London), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Approaches to dance==\n\n===Concert dance===\nConcert dance, like [[opera]], generally depends for its large-scale form upon a [[narrative]] [[dramatic structure]]. The movements and gestures of the [[choreography]] are primarily intended to [[mime]] the personality and aims of the characters and their part in the plot.&lt;ref&gt;Laban, Rudolf, ''The Mastery of Movement'', MacDonald and Evans, London, 1960, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Such theatrical requirements tend towards longer, freer movements than those usual in non-narrative dance styles. On the other hand, the ''[[ballet blanc]]'', developed in the 19th century, allows interludes of rhythmic dance that developed into entirely &quot;plotless&quot; ballets in the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;Minden, Eliza Gaynor, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S-RuSzcrBnAC&amp;dq=%22ballet+blanc%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The Ballet Companion: A Dancer's Guide''], Simon and Schuster, 2007, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and that allowed fast, rhythmic dance-steps such as those of the ''petit allegro''. A well-known example is ''[[Danse des petits cygnes|The Cygnets' Dance]]'' in act two of ''[[Swan Lake]]''.\n\nThe [[ballet]] developed out of courtly dramatic productions of 16th- and 17th-century France and Italy and for some time dancers performed dances developed from those familiar from the musical suite,&lt;ref&gt;Thoinot Arbeau, ''Orchesography'', trans. by Mary Stewart Evans, with notes by Julia Sutton, New York: Dover, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; all of which were defined by definite rhythms closely identified with each dance. These appeared as [[character dance]]s in the era of [[romantic nationalism]].\n\nBallet reached widespread vogue in the romantic era, accompanied by a larger orchestra and grander musical conceptions that did not lend themselves easily to rhythmic clarity and by dance that emphasised dramatic mime. A broader concept of rhythm was needed, that which [[Rudolf Laban]] terms the &quot;rhythm and shape&quot; of movement that communicates character, emotion and intention,&lt;ref&gt;Laban, Rudolf, ''The Mastery of Movement'', MacDonald and Evans, London, 1960, pp. 2, 4 ''et passim''&lt;/ref&gt; while only certain scenes required the exact synchronisation of step and music essential to other dance styles, so that, to Laban, modern Europeans seemed totally unable to grasp the meaning of &quot;primitive rhythmic movements&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Laban, Rudolf, ''The Mastery of Movement'', MacDonald and Evans, London, 1960, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; a situation that began to change in the 20th century with such productions as [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' with its new rhythmic language evoking primal feelings of a primitive past.&lt;ref&gt;Abigail Wagner, [https://www.lawrence.edu/mfhe/www_web_student/Everyone/A%20Different%20Type%20of%20Rhythm.pdf ''A Different Type of Rhythm''], Lawrence University, Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIndian classical dance styles, like ballet, are often in dramatic form, so that there is a similar complementarity between narrative expression and &quot;pure&quot; dance. In this case, however, the two are separately defined, though not always separately performed. The rhythmic elements, which are abstract and technical, are known as ''nritta''. Both this and expressive dance ''(nritya)'', though, are closely tied to the rhythmic system (''[[Tala (music)|tala]]''). Teachers have adapted the spoken rhythmic mnemonic system called ''[[Bol (music)|bol]]'' to the needs of dancers.\n\nJapanese classical dance-theatre styles such as [[Kabuki]] and [[Noh]], like Indian dance-drama, distinguish between narrative and abstract dance productions. The three main categories of kabuki are ''[[jidaimono]]'' (historical), ''[[sewamono]]'' (domestic) and ''[[shosagoto]]'' (dance pieces).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kabuki MIT Global Shakespeares&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://globalshakespeares.mit.edu/glossary/kabuki/ | title=Kabuki \u00ab MIT Global Shakespeares | accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat similarly, Noh distinguishes between ''Geki Noh'', based around the advancement of plot and the narration of action, and ''Fury\u016b Noh'', dance pieces involving acrobatics, stage properties, multiple characters and elaborate stage action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ortolani&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ge8cWl8OT3gC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=mugen-no+Genzai-no+waki-no#v=onepage |page=132 |title=The Japanese theatre: from shamanistic ritual to contemporary pluralism |first=Benito |last=Ortolani| publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995 |isbn=978-0-691-04333-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Participatory and social dance===\n[[Social dances]], those intended for participation rather than for an audience, may include various forms of mime and narrative, but are typically set much more closely to the rhythmic pattern of music, so that terms like [[waltz]] and [[polka]] refer as much to musical pieces as to the dance itself. The rhythm of the dancers' feet may even form an essential part of the music, as in [[tap dance]]. African dance, for example, is rooted in fixed basic steps, but may also allow a high degree of rhythmic interpretation: the feet or the trunk mark the basic pulse while cross-rhythms are picked up by shoulders, knees, or head, with the best dancers simultaneously giving plastic expression to all the elements of the [[polyrhythm]]ic pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Ayansu, E.S. and Whitfield, P.

Its music is coordinated by a musical instrument called the 'Dhol'. Bhangra is not just music but a dance, a celebration of the harvest where people beat the dhol (drum), sing Boliyaan (lyrics) and dance. It developed further with the Vaisakhi festival of the [[Sikh]]s.\n\nThe [[dances of Sri Lanka]] include the devil dances (''yakun natima''), a carefully crafted ritual reaching far back into Sri Lanka's pre-Buddhist past that combines ancient &quot;[[Ayurvedic]]&quot; concepts of disease causation with [[psychological manipulation]] and combines many aspects including Sinhalese cosmology.

Some European folk dances such as the [[square dance]] were brought to the [[New World]] and subsequently became part of American culture.\n\n[[Ballet]] developed first in Italy and then in France from lavish court spectacles that combined music, drama, poetry, song, costumes and dance. Members of the court nobility took part as performers. During the reign of [[Louis XIV]], himself a dancer, dance became more codified. Professional dancers began to take the place of court amateurs, and ballet masters were licensed by the French government. The first ballet dance academy was the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Danse (Royal Dance Academy), opened in Paris in 1661. Shortly thereafter, the first institutionalized ballet troupe, associated with the Academy, was formed; this troupe began as an all-male ensemble but by 1681 opened to include women as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;lecomte&quot;/&gt;\n\n[[20th century concert dance]] brought an explosion of innovation in dance style characterized by an exploration of freer technique. Early pioneers of what became known as [[modern dance]] include [[Loie Fuller]], [[Isadora Duncan]], [[Mary Wigman]] and [[Ruth St. Denis]]. The relationship of music to dance serves as the basis for [[Eurhythmics]], devised by [[Emile Jaques-Dalcroze]], which was influential to the development of Modern dance and modern ballet through artists such as [[Marie Rambert]]. [[Eurythmy]], developed by [[Rudolf Steiner]] and [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers]], combines formal elements reminiscent of traditional dance with the new freer style, and introduced a complex new vocabulary to dance. In the 1920s, important founders of the new style such as [[Martha Graham]] and [[Doris Humphrey]] began their work. Since this time, a wide variety of dance styles have been developed; see [[Modern dance]].\n\n[[African American dance]] developed in everyday spaces, rather than in dance studios, schools or companies. [[Tap dance]], [[disco]], [[jazz dance]], [[swing dance]], [[hip hop dance]], the [[lindy hop]] with its relationship to [[rock and roll|rock and roll music]] and [[rock and roll (dance)|rock and roll dance]] have had a global influence. Dance styles fusing classical ballet technique with African-American dance have also appeared in the 21st century, including [[Hiplet (dance style)|Hiplet]].&lt;ref name=kourlas&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/arts/dance/hiplet-an-implausible-hybrid-plants-itself-on-pointe.html|title=Hiplet: An Implausible Hybrid Plants Itself on Pointe|last=Kourlas|first=Gia|date=2016-09-02|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Latin America===\n[[File:HK TST night \u67cf\u9e97\u8cfc\u7269\u5927\u9053 Park Lane Shopper's Boulevard \u5df4\u897f Brasil \u68ee\u5df4\u821e\u5a18 Samba female dancers Nov-2010 02.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.1| [[samba school|Street samba]] dancers perform in carnival parades and contests]]\nDance is central to [[Latin America]]n social life and culture.

The professional life of a dancer is generally one of constantly changing work situations, strong competitive pressure and low pay. Consequently, professional dancers often must supplement their incomes to achieve financial stability. In the U.S. many professional dancers belong to unions (such as the [[American Guild of Musical Artists]], [[Screen Actors Guild]] and [[Actors' Equity Association]]) that establish working conditions and minimum salaries for their members. Professional dancers must possess large amounts of athleticism. To lead a successful career, it is advantageous to be versatile in many styles of dance, have a strong technical background and to utilize other forms of physical training to remain fit and healthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sagolla|first=Lisa|date=April 24, 2008|title=Untitled|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=fa35d8ae-239b-4764-b82f-f58a07a15475%40sessionmgr4006&amp;vid=11&amp;hid=4104&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=32038206&amp;db=ibh|journal=International Bibliography of Theatre &amp; Dance with Full Text|volume= 15| issue = 17 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Dance teachers===\nDance teachers typically focus on teaching dance performance, or coaching competitive dancers, or both. They typically have performance experience in the types of dance they teach or coach. For example, [[dancesport]] teachers and coaches are often tournament dancers or former dancesport performers. Dance teachers may be self-employed, or employed by [[dance school]]s or general education institutions with dance programs. Some work for university programs or other schools that are associated with professional classical dance (e.g., ballet) or modern dance companies. Others are employed by smaller, privately owned dance schools that offer dance training and performance coaching for various types of dance.\n\n===Choreographers===\n[[Choreography (dance)|Choreographers]] are the ones that design the dancing movements within a dance, they are often university trained and are typically employed for particular projects or, more rarely may work on contract as the resident choreographer for a specific dance company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Risner|first=Doug|date=December 2000|title=Making Dance, Making Sense: Epistemology and choreography|journal=Research in Dance Education|volume=1|issue=2|pages=155\u2013172|doi=10.1080/713694259|s2cid=143435623|issn=1464-7893}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Competitions==\n[[File:MIT 2006 Standard Prechamp Final 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.45|An amateur dancesport competition, featuring the [[Viennese Waltz]]]]\n\nA '''dance competition''' is an organized event in which contestants perform dances before a judge or judges for awards, and in some cases, monetary prizes.

According to [[radiometric dating]] estimation and other evidence, Earth formed [[Age of Earth|over 4.5 billion years ago]]. [[Gravity of Earth|Earth's gravity]] interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the [[Moon]], which is Earth's only [[natural satellite]]. Earth [[Earth's orbit|orbits around the Sun]] in about 365.25 [[solar time|days]].\n\n[[#Axial tilt and seasons|Earth's axis of rotation]] is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing [[season]]s on Earth. The [[Gravity|gravitational]] interaction between Earth and the Moon causes [[tide]]s, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and [[Tidal acceleration|gradually slows its rotation]]. Earth is the densest planet in the [[Solar System]] and the largest and most massive of the four [[terrestrial planet|rocky planet]]s.\n\nEarth's outer layer ([[Lithosphere#Earth's lithosphere|lithosphere]]) is divided into several rigid [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] that migrate across the surface over many millions of years. About 29% of Earth's surface is [[Land#History of land on Earth|land]] consisting of [[continent]]s and [[island]]s. The remaining 71% is [[Water distribution on Earth|covered with water]], mostly by [[ocean]]s but also [[lake]]s, [[river]]s and other [[fresh water]], which all together constitute the [[hydrosphere]]. The majority of [[Polar regions of Earth|Earth's polar regions]] are covered in [[ice]], including the [[Antarctic ice sheet]] and the [[sea ice]] of the [[Arctic ice pack]]. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron [[Earth's inner core|inner core]], a liquid [[Earth's outer core|outer core]] that generates [[Earth's magnetic field]], and a convecting [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] that drives plate tectonics.\n\nWithin the first billion years of [[History of Earth|Earth's history]], [[Abiogenesis|life appeared in the oceans]] and began to affect [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] and surface, leading to the proliferation of [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] and, [[Great Oxidation Event|later]], [[aerobic organisms]]. Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as early as 4.1&amp;nbsp;billion years ago. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties and [[Geological history of Earth|geological history]] have allowed life to [[Evolution|evolve]] and thrive. In the [[Timeline of the evolutionary history of life|history of life on Earth]], [[biodiversity]] has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by [[extinction event|mass extinctions]]. Over 99% of all [[species]] that ever lived on Earth are [[extinct]]. Estimates of the [[number of species]] on Earth today vary widely; most species have not been [[Species description|described]]. [[World population|Almost 8&amp;nbsp;billion humans]] live on Earth and depend on its [[biosphere]] and [[natural resource]]s for their survival.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Beowulf - eorthan.jpg|thumb|left|An early appearance of the word &quot;eor\u00f0an&quot; (earth) in ''[[Beowulf]]'']]\nThe [[modern English]] word {{anchor|Name|Etymology}} ''Earth'' developed, via [[Middle English]],{{refn|group=n|Middle English spellings include ''eor\u00fee'', ''er\u00fee'', ''erde'', and ''erthe''.&lt;ref name=oedearth /&gt;}} from an [[Old English]] noun most often spelled ''{{linktext|eor\u00f0e}}''.&lt;ref name=oedearth&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, {{nowrap|3rd ed.}} &quot;earth, ''n.\u00b9''&quot; Oxford University Press (Oxford), 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It has cognates in every [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]], and their [[proto-Germanic|ancestral root]] has been reconstructed as [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/er\u00fe\u014d|*''er\u00fe\u014d'']].

The outer layer is a chemically distinct [[Silicate minerals|silicate]] solid crust, which is underlain by a highly [[viscous]] solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the [[Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity]]. The thickness of the crust varies from about {{convert|6|km|mi}} under the oceans to {{convert|30|-|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the [[upper mantle]] are collectively known as the lithosphere, and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed. Beneath the lithosphere is the [[asthenosphere]], a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at {{convert|410|and|660|km|mi|abbr=on}} below the surface, spanning a [[Transition zone (Earth)|transition zone]] that separates the upper and lower mantle.

Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the surface. This lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is [[atmospheric circulation]] that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;moran2005&quot; /&gt;\n\nThe primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the [[trade winds]] in the equatorial region below 30\u00b0 latitude and the [[westerlies]] in the mid-latitudes between 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0.&lt;ref name=&quot;berger2002&quot; /&gt; [[Ocean current]]s are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the [[thermohaline circulation]] that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.&lt;ref name=rahmstorf2003 /&gt;\n\nWater vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;moran2005&quot; /&gt; Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This [[water cycle]] is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.&lt;ref name=hydrologic_cycle /&gt;\n\nThe amount of solar energy reaching Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about {{convert|0.4|C-change|F-change|1}} per degree of latitude from the equator.&lt;ref name=sadava_heller2006 /&gt; Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate.

For example, the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]] has more moderate climate than similarly northern latitudes of [[northern Canada]].\n* The [[wind]] enables this moderating effect. The windward side of a land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side. In the Northern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is west-to-east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. This is seen in Eastern North America and Western Europe, where rough continental climates appear on the east coast on parallels with mild climates on the other side of the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/13573-east-coast-colder-europe-west-coast.html |title=Why U.S. East Coast is colder than Europe's West Coast |publisher=Live Science |date=5 April 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Southern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is east-to-west, and the eastern coasts are milder.\n* The climate is colder at high altitudes than at sea level because of the decreased air density.\n\nThe commonly used [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system has five broad groups ([[tropical climate|humid tropics]], [[arid]], [[humid subtropical climate|humid middle latitudes]], [[Continental climate|continental]] and cold [[polar climate|polar]]), which are further divided into more specific subtypes.&lt;ref name=&quot;berger2002&quot; /&gt; The K\u00f6ppen system rates regions of terrain based on observed temperature and precipitation.\n\nSurface [[Highest temperature recorded on Earth|air temperature can rise to]] around {{convert|55|C|F}} in [[hot desert]]s, such as [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]], and [[Lowest temperature recorded on Earth|can fall as low as]] {{convert|-90|C|F}} in [[Antarctica]].\n\n==== Upper atmosphere ====\n[[File:Full moon partially obscured by atmosphere.jpg|thumb|This view from orbit shows the [[full moon]] partially obscured by Earth's atmosphere.]]\nAbove the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the [[stratosphere]], [[mesosphere]], and [[thermosphere]].&lt;ref name=&quot;atmosphere&quot; /&gt; Each layer has a different [[lapse rate]], defining the rate of change in temperature with height.

This causes a slow but steady [[Atmospheric escape|loss of the atmosphere into space]]. Because unfixed [[hydrogen]] has a low [[molecular mass]], it can achieve [[escape velocity]] more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases.&lt;ref name=jas31_4_1118 /&gt; The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially [[redox|reducing]] state to its current [[Redox|oxidizing]] one.

Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with [[summer]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] occurring when the [[Tropic of Cancer]] is facing the Sun, and [[winter]] taking place when the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.\n\nAbove the [[Arctic Circle]], an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year, up to six months at the North Pole itself, a [[polar night]]. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with the [[South Pole]] oriented opposite the direction of the [[North Pole]]. Six months later, this pole will experience a [[midnight sun]], a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.\n\nBy astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the [[solstice]]s\u2014the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun\u2014and the [[equinox]]es, when Earth's rotational axis is aligned with its orbital axis. In the Northern Hemisphere, [[winter solstice]] currently occurs around 21 December; [[summer solstice]] is near 21 June, [[March equinox|spring equinox]] is around 20 March and [[September equinox|autumnal equinox]] is about 22 or 23 September.

Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface.

It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] is larger relative to the [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]]. The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as &quot;moons&quot;, after Earth's.\n\nThe gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes [[tide]]s on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its [[tidal locking]]: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the [[lunar phase]]s; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the [[terminator (solar)|solar terminator]].\n\nDue to their [[Tidal acceleration|tidal interaction]], the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately {{convert|38|mm/yr|in/yr|abbr=on}}.

[[Paleontology|Paleontological]] evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon.&lt;ref name=aaa428_261 /&gt; Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the [[torque]]s applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as appears to be the case for Mars.&lt;ref name=nature410_6830_773 /&gt;\n\nViewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The [[angular size]] (or [[solid angle]]) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant.&lt;ref name=angular /&gt; This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.\n\nThe most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the [[giant-impact hypothesis]], states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.&lt;ref name=&quot;canup_asphaug2001b&quot;/&gt;\n\n== Asteroids and artificial satellites ==\n[[File:Tracy Caldwell Dyson in Cupola ISS.jpg|thumb|[[Tracy Caldwell Dyson]] viewing Earth from the [[ISS]] Cupola, 2010]]\nEarth has at least five [[Quasi-satellite|co-orbital asteroids]], including [[3753 Cruithne]] and {{mpl|2002 AA|29}}.&lt;ref name=whitehouse20021021 /&gt;&lt;ref name=christou_asher2011 /&gt; A [[Earth trojan|trojan asteroid]] companion, {{mpl|2010 TK|7}}, is [[Libration|librating]] around the leading [[Lagrangian point|Lagrange triangular point]], L4, in [[Earth's orbit]] around the Sun.&lt;ref name=Connors /&gt;&lt;ref name=Choi /&gt;\n\nThe tiny [[near-Earth asteroid]] {{mpl|2006 RH|120}} makes close approaches to the Earth\u2013Moon system roughly every twenty years.

Engineers need proficient knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects. As a result, many engineers continue to learn new material throughout their career.\n\nIf multiple solutions exist, engineers weigh each design choice based on their merit and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. The task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to yield a successful result. It is generally insufficient to build a technically successful product, rather, it must also meet further requirements.\n\nConstraints may include available resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, [[Safety engineering|safety]], marketability, productivity, and [[Serviceability (computer)|serviceability]]. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive [[specifications]] for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated.\n\n===Problem solving===\n[[File:Booster-Layout.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|A drawing for a booster engine for [[steam locomotive]]s. Engineering is applied to [[design]], with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science.]]\nEngineers use their knowledge of [[science]], [[mathematics]], [[logic]], [[economics]], and [[empirical knowledge|appropriate experience]] or [[tacit knowledge]] to find suitable solutions to a problem.

[[Genrich Altshuller]], after gathering statistics on a large number of [[patent]]s, suggested that [[compromise]]s are at the heart of &quot;[[level of invention|low-level]]&quot; engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theoriesaboutengineering.org/genrich_altshuller.html|title=Theories About Engineering \u2013 Genrich Altshuller|website=theoriesaboutengineering.org|access-date=September 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nEngineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: [[prototype]]s, [[scale model]]s, [[simulation]]s, [[destructive testing|destructive tests]], [[nondestructive testing|nondestructive tests]], and [[stress testing|stress tests]]. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/engineering-design-process/engineering-design-compare-scientific-method|title=Comparing the Engineering Design Process and the Scientific Method|website=Science Buddies|language=en-US|access-date=September 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nEngineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large. Engineers typically include a [[factor of safety]] in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure.\n\nThe study of failed products is known as [[forensic engineering]] and can help the [[product design]]er in evaluating his or her design in the light of real conditions. The discipline is of greatest value after disasters, such as [[bridge collapse]]s, when careful analysis is needed to establish the cause or causes of the failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asce.org/forensic-engineering/forensic-engineering/|title=Forensic Engineering {{!}} ASCE|website=www.asce.org|access-date=September 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Computer use===\n[[File:CFD Shuttle.jpg|thumb|left|A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around a [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] during re-entry.

As well as the typical business [[application software]] there are a number of computer aided applications ([[computer-aided technologies]]) specifically for engineering. Computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes, which can be solved using [[numerical method]]s.\n\n[[File:WorldWideWebAroundWikipedia.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Graphic representation of a minute fraction of the WWW, demonstrating [[hyperlink]]s]]\nOne of the most widely used [[design tool]]s in the profession is [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software.  It enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with [[digital mockup]] (DMU) and [[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]] software such as [[Finite element method|finite element method analysis]] or [[analytic element method]] allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.\n\nThese allow products and components to be checked for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and kinematics.

Almost all engineering projects are obligated to some sort of financing agency: a company, a set of investors, or a government.  The few types of engineering that are minimally constrained by such issues are ''[[pro bono]]'' engineering and [[open design|open-design]] engineering.\n\nBy its very nature engineering has interconnections with society, culture and human behavior.  Every product or construction used by modern society is influenced by engineering. The results of engineering activity influence changes to the environment, society and economies, and its application brings with it a responsibility and public safety.\n\nEngineering projects can be subject to controversy. Examples from different engineering disciplines include the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s, the [[Three Gorges Dam]], the design and use of [[sport utility vehicle]]s and the extraction of [[Fuel oil|oil]]. In response, some western engineering companies have enacted serious [[Corporate social responsibility|corporate and social responsibility]] policies.\n\nEngineering is a key driver of innovation and human development.

Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature. Engineers stress innovation and invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people can use. That something can be a complex system, device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what already exists. Since a design has to be realistic and functional, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristics data defined.  In the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions. Most often, they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and mechanics. Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession. Thus engineering sciences were born.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fung&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical and Computational Solid Mechanics, YC Fung and P.

The demand for management-focused engineers (or from the opposite perspective, managers with an understanding of engineering), has resulted in the development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles. During an engineering management course, students will develop [[industrial engineering]] skills, knowledge, and expertise, alongside knowledge of business administration, management techniques, and strategic thinking.  Engineers specializing in change management must have in-depth knowledge of the application of [[industrial and organizational psychology]] principles and methods.  Professional engineers often train as [[certified management consultant]]s in the very specialized field of [[management consulting]] applied to engineering practice or the engineering sector.  This work often deals with large scale complex [[business transformation]] or [[Business process management]] initiatives in aerospace and defence, automotive, oil and gas, machinery, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, electrical &amp; electronics, power distribution &amp; generation, utilities and transportation systems.

In pre-[[Literacy|literate]] societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their [[knowledge]] beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed.

Around 1450, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilizations&amp;nbsp;\u2013 as with the [[Jesuit China missions]] who played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge, science, and culture between China and Europe, translating works from Europe like [[Euclid's Elements]] for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of [[Confucius]] for European audiences. [[The Enlightenment]] saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in Europe.\n\nIn most countries today, full-time education, whether at school or [[homeschooling|otherwise]], is compulsory for all children up to a certain age.

Globally, in 2008, around 89% of children aged six to twelve were enrolled in primary education, and this proportion was rising.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, Education For All Monitoring Report 2008, Net Enrollment Rate in primary education&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Education For All]] programs driven by [[UNESCO]], most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory. The division between primary and [[secondary education]] is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education systems have separate [[middle school]]s, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fifteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as ''primary schools ''or ''elementary schools''. Primary schools are often subdivided into [[infant school]]s and [[junior school]].\n\nIn India, for example, [[Compulsory education#Variation in countries|compulsory education]] spans over twelve years, with eight years of elementary education, five years of primary schooling and three years of upper primary schooling. Various states in the republic of India provide 12 years of compulsory school education based on a national [[curriculum]] framework designed by the [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]].\n\n===Secondary===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\n{{Main|Secondary education}}\nThis covers the two ISCED levels, ISCED 2: Lower Secondary Education and ISCED 3: Upper Secondary Education.&lt;ref name=ISCED2011/&gt;\n\nIn most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during [[adolescence]].  In the United States, Canada, and [[Australia]], primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as [[K\u201312 (education)|K-12]] education, and in New Zealand Year 1\u201313 is used. The purpose of secondary education can be to give [[common knowledge]], to prepare for [[higher education]], or to train directly in a [[profession]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nSecondary education in the United States did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required [[skilled worker]]s. In order to meet this new job demand, [[High school (North America)|high schools]] were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for [[White-collar worker|white collar]] or skilled [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]] work. This proved beneficial for both employers and employees, since the improved human capital lowered costs for the employer, while skilled employees received higher wages.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nSecondary education has a longer history in Europe, where grammar schools or academies date from as early as the 6th century, {{efn|King's School Canterbury has been in continuous existence from 597 AD}} in the form of [[Public education|public schools]], [[fee-paying school]]s, or charitable educational foundations, which themselves date even further back.&lt;!-- needs to be rewritten--&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIt spans the period between the typically universal compulsory, [[primary education]] to the optional, selective [[Tertiary education|tertiary]], &quot;postsecondary&quot;, or &quot;[[Higher education|higher]]&quot; education of ISCED 5 and 6 (e.g. [[university]]), and the ISCED 4 [[Further education]] or [[vocational school]].&lt;ref name=ISCED2011/&gt;\n\nDepending on the system, schools for this period, or a part of it, maybe called secondary or [[high school]]s, [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]], [[lyceum]]s, middle schools, [[college]]s, or vocational schools. The exact meaning of any of these terms varies from one system to another. The exact boundary between primary and secondary education also varies from country to country and even within them but is generally around the seventh to the tenth year of schooling.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n====Lower====\nPrograms at ISCED level 2, lower secondary education are usually organized around a more subject-oriented curriculum; differing from primary education. Teachers typically have\npedagogical training in the specific subjects and, more often than at ISCED level 1, a class of\nstudents will have several teachers, each with specialized knowledge of the subjects they teach. Programmes at ISCED level 2, aim is to lay the foundation for lifelong learning and human development upon introducing theoretical concepts across a broad range of subjects which can be developed in future stages. Some education systems may offer vocational education programs during ISCED level 2 providing skills relevant to employment.&lt;ref name=ISCED2011/&gt;\n\n====Upper====\nPrograms at ISCED level 3, or upper secondary education, are typically designed to complete the secondary education process. They lead to skills relevant to employment and the skill necessary to engage in tertiary courses. They offer students more varied, specialized and in-depth instruction. They are more differentiated, with range of options and learning streams.&lt;ref name=ISCED2011/&gt;\n\n[[Community college]]s offer another option at this transitional stage of education.

The report examined the main challenges encountered by development organizations which support LCPSs.&lt;ref name=eldis/&gt; Surveys suggest these types of schools are expanding across Africa and Asia. This success is attributed to excess demand. These surveys found concern for:\n* Equity: This concern is widely found in the literature, suggesting the growth in low-cost private schooling may be exacerbating or perpetuating already existing inequalities in developing countries, between urban and rural populations, lower- and higher-income families, and between girls and boys. The report findings suggest that girls may be under represented and that LCPS are reaching low-income families in smaller numbers than higher-income families.&lt;ref name=eldis/&gt;\n* Quality and educational outcomes: It is difficult to generalize about the quality of private schools. While most achieve better results than government counterparts, even after their social background is taken into account, some studies find the opposite. Quality in terms of levels of teacher absence, teaching activity, and pupil to teacher ratios in some countries are better in LCPSs than in government schools.&lt;ref name=eldis/&gt;\n* Choice and affordability for the poor: Parents can choose private schools because of perceptions of better-quality teaching and facilities, and an English language instruction preference. Nevertheless, the concept of 'choice' does not apply in all contexts, or to all groups in society, partly because of limited affordability (which excludes most of the poorest) and other forms of exclusion, related to caste or social status.&lt;ref name=eldis/&gt;\n* Cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability: There is evidence that private schools operate at low cost by keeping teacher salaries low, and their financial situation may be precarious where they are reliant on fees from low-income households.&lt;ref name=eldis/&gt;\n\nThe report showed some cases of successful voucher where there was an oversupply of quality private places and an efficient administrative authority and of subsidy programs. Evaluations of the effectiveness of international support to the sector are rare.&lt;ref name=eldis/&gt; Addressing regulatory ineffectiveness is a key challenge.

The terms &quot;educational psychology&quot; and &quot;school psychology&quot; are often used interchangeably. Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as [[gifted]] children and those with specific [[disabilities]].\n[[File:2013. \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\u043a 336.jpg|thumb|Knowledge Day in [[Donetsk]], [[Ukraine]], 2013]]\nEducational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by [[psychology]], bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between [[medicine]] and [[biology]]. Educational psychology, in turn, informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies, including [[instructional design]], [[educational technology]], curriculum development, [[organizational learning]], [[special education]] and [[classroom management]]. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to [[cognitive science]] and the [[learning sciences]]. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks (Lucas, Blazek, &amp; Raley, 2006).\n\n===Psychological relationship===\n{{Main|Psychology of education}}\n[[Intelligence]] is an important factor in how the individual responds to education.

A curriculum is prescriptive and is based on a more general [[syllabus]] which merely specifies what topics must be understood and to what level to achieve a particular grade or standard.\n\nAn [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] is a branch of knowledge which is formally taught, either at the university \u2013 or via some other such method. Each discipline usually has several sub-disciplines or branches, and distinguishing lines are often both arbitrary and ambiguous.

This distinction started around 1906 with the invention by [[Lee De Forest]] of the [[triode]], which made electrical [[Amplifier|amplification]] of weak [[radio signal]]s and audio signals possible with a non-mechanical device.  Until 1950, this field was called &quot;radio technology&quot; because its principal application was the design and theory of radio [[transmitter]]s, [[Receiver (radio)|receivers]], and [[vacuum tube]]s.\n\nThe term &quot;[[solid-state electronics]]&quot; emerged after the first working [[transistor]] was invented by [[William Shockley]], [[Walter Houser Brattain]] and [[John Bardeen]] at [[Bell Labs]] in 1947. The [[MOSFET]] (MOS transistor) was later invented by [[Mohamed Atalla]] and [[Dawon Kahng]] at Bell Labs in 1959. The MOSFET was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses, revolutionizing the [[electronics industry]], and playing a central role in the [[microelectronics]] revolution and [[Digital Revolution]]. The MOSFET has since become the basic element in most modern electronic equipment, and is the most widely used electronic device in the world.\n\nElectronics is widely used in [[information processing]], [[telecommunication]], and [[signal processing]].  The ability of electronic devices to act as [[switch]]es makes digital information-processing possible. Interconnection technologies such as [[circuit board]]s, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed [[electronic component]]s into a regular working [[system]], called an '''electronic system'''; examples are [[computer]]s or [[control system]]s.

The [[nonlinear]] behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible.\n\nThe study of [[semiconductor devices]] and related technology is considered a branch of [[solid-state physics]], whereas the design and construction of [[electronic circuit]]s to solve practical problems come under [[electronics engineering]].

Components are generally intended to be connected together, usually by being soldered to a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB), to create an electronic circuit with a particular function (for example an [[amplifier]], [[radio receiver]], or [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]]). Components may be packaged singly, or in more complex groups as [[integrated circuit]]s. Some common electronic components are [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[resistor]]s, [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s, etc. Components are often categorized as active (e.g. transistors and [[thyristor]]s) or [[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] (e.g. resistors, diodes, inductors and capacitors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Power Electronics and Variable Frequency Drives: Technology and Applications |publisher= Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/9780470547113|year = 1996|isbn = 978-0-470-54711-3|s2cid= 107126716|editor1-last= Bose|editor1-first= Bimal K}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n== History of electronic components ==\n{{See also|History of electronic engineering|Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering}}[[Vacuum tube]]s (Thermionic valves) were among the earliest electronic components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|date=2012|title=The age of vacuum tubes: Early devices and the rise of radio communications|journal=IEEE Ind.

A particular device may consist of circuitry that has one or the other or a mix of the two types.\n\n=== Analog circuits ===\n{{Main|Analog electronics}}\n[[File:HitachiJ100A.jpg|right|thumb|Hitachi J100 adjustable frequency drive chassis]]\nMost [[analog signal|analog]] electronic appliances, such as [[radio]] receivers, are constructed from combinations of a few types of basic circuits. [[Analog circuits]] use a continuous range of voltage or current as opposed to discrete levels as in digital circuits.\n\nThe number of different analog circuits so far devised is huge, especially because a 'circuit' can be defined as anything from a single component, to systems containing thousands of components.\n\nAnalog circuits are sometimes called [[linear circuit]]s although many non-linear effects are used in analog circuits such as mixers, modulators, etc. Good examples of analog circuits include vacuum tube and transistor amplifiers, operational amplifiers and oscillators.\n\nOne rarely finds modern circuits that are entirely analog. These days analog circuitry may use digital or even microprocessor techniques to improve performance. This type of circuit is usually called &quot;mixed signal&quot; rather than analog or digital.\n\nSometimes it may be difficult to differentiate between analog and digital circuits as they have elements of both linear and non-linear operation. An example is the comparator which takes in a continuous range of voltage but only outputs one of two levels as in a digital circuit. Similarly, an overdriven transistor amplifier can take on the characteristics of a controlled [[switch]] having essentially two levels of output.  In fact, many digital circuits are actually implemented as variations of analog circuits similar to this example&amp;nbsp;\u2013 after all, all aspects of the real physical world are essentially analog, so digital effects are only realized by constraining analog behavior.\n\n=== Digital circuits ===\n{{Main|Digital electronics}}\nDigital circuits are electric circuits based on a number of discrete voltage levels. Digital circuits are the most common physical representation of [[Boolean logic|Boolean algebra]], and are the basis of all digital computers. To most engineers, the terms &quot;digital circuit&quot;, &quot;digital system&quot; and &quot;logic&quot; are interchangeable in the context of digital circuits.\nMost digital circuits use a binary system with two voltage levels labeled &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;. Often logic &quot;0&quot; will be a lower voltage and referred to as &quot;Low&quot; while logic &quot;1&quot; is referred to as &quot;High&quot;.  However, some systems use the reverse definition (&quot;0&quot; is &quot;High&quot;) or are current based.  Quite often the logic designer may reverse these definitions from one circuit to the next as he sees fit to facilitate his design.  The definition of the levels as &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot; is arbitrary.\n\n[[Ternary computer|Ternary]] (with three states) logic has been studied, and some prototype computers made.\n\n[[Computer]]s, electronic [[quartz clock|clocks]], and [[programmable logic controller]]s (used to control industrial processes) are constructed of [[Digital data|digital]] circuits. [[Digital signal processor]]s are another example.\n\nBuilding blocks:\n* [[Metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor]] (MOSFET)\n* [[Logic gate]]s\n* [[Adder (electronics)|Adders]]\n* [[Flip-flop (electronics)|Flip-flops]]\n* [[Counter (digital)|Counters]]\n* [[Processor register|Registers]]\n* [[Multiplexer]]s\n* [[Schmitt trigger]]s\n\nHighly integrated devices:\n* [[Memory chip]]\n* [[Microprocessor]]s\n* [[Microcontroller]]s\n* [[Application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC)\n* [[Digital signal processor]] (DSP)\n* [[Field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA)\n\n== Heat dissipation and thermal management ==\n{{Main|Thermal management of electronic devices and systems}}\n[[Heat]] generated by electronic circuitry must be dissipated to prevent immediate failure and improve long term reliability. Heat dissipation is mostly achieved by passive conduction/convection. Means to achieve greater dissipation include [[heat sink]]s and [[Mechanical fan|fans]] for air cooling, and other forms of [[computer cooling]] such as [[water cooling]]. These techniques use [[convection]], [[Heat conduction|conduction]], and [[radiation]] of heat energy.\n\n== Noise ==\n{{Main|Electronic noise}}\nElectronic noise is defined&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms {{ISBN|978-0-471-42806-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as unwanted disturbances superposed on a useful signal that tend to obscure its information content. Noise is not the same as signal distortion caused by a circuit. Noise is associated with all electronic circuits. Noise may be electromagnetically or thermally generated, which can be decreased by lowering the [[operating temperature]] of the circuit. Other types of noise, such as [[shot noise]] cannot be removed as they are due to limitations in physical properties.\n\n== Electronics theory ==\n{{Main|Mathematical methods in electronics}}\n\nMathematical methods are integral to the study of electronics. To become proficient in electronics it is also necessary to become proficient in the mathematics of circuit analysis.\n\nCircuit analysis is the study of methods of solving generally linear systems for unknown variables such as the voltage at a certain [[Node (circuits)|node]] or the current through a certain [[Path (graph theory)|branch]] of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|network]]. A common analytical tool for this is the [[SPICE]] circuit simulator.\n\nAlso important to electronics is the study and understanding of [[electromagnetic field]] theory.\n\n== Electronics lab ==\n{{Main|Electronic circuit simulation}}\n\nDue to the complex nature of electronics theory, laboratory experimentation is an important part of the development of electronic devices.  These experiments are used to test or verify the engineer's design and detect errors.  Historically, electronics labs have consisted of electronics devices and equipment located in a physical space, although in more recent years the trend has been towards electronics lab simulation software, such as [[CircuitLogix]], [[Multisim]], and [[PSpice]].\n\n== Computer aided design (CAD) ==\n{{Main|Electronic design automation}}\n\nToday's electronics engineers have the ability to [[Circuit design|design]] [[Electronic circuit|circuits]] using premanufactured building blocks such as [[power supply|power supplies]], [[semiconductor]]s (i.e. semiconductor devices, such as [[transistor]]s), and [[integrated circuit]]s. [[Electronic design automation]] software programs include [[schematic capture]] programs and [[printed circuit board]] design programs. Popular names in the EDA software world are NI Multisim, Cadence ([[ORCAD]]), [[EAGLE (program)|EAGLE]] PCB and Schematic, Mentor (PADS PCB and LOGIC Schematic), Altium (Protel), LabCentre Electronics (Proteus), gEDA, KiCad and many others.\n\n== Packaging methods ==\n{{Main|Electronic packaging}}\nMany different methods of connecting components have been used over the years. For instance, early electronics often used [[Point-to-point construction|point to point wiring]] with components attached to wooden breadboards to construct circuits. [[Printed circuit board#&quot;Cordwood&quot; construction|Cordwood construction]] and [[wire wrap]] were other methods used. Most modern day electronics now use printed circuit boards made of materials such as [[FR-4|FR4]], or the cheaper (and less hard-wearing) Synthetic Resin Bonded Paper ([[SRBP]], also known as Paxoline/Paxolin (trade marks) and FR2) \u2013 characterised by its brown colour. Health and environmental concerns associated with electronics assembly have gained increased attention in recent years, especially for products destined to the European Union, with its [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive]] (RoHS) and [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive]] (WEEE), which went into force in July 2006.\n\n== Electronic systems design ==\n{{Main|Systems engineering}}\nElectronic systems design deals with the multi-disciplinary design issues of complex electronic devices and systems, such as [[mobile phone]]s and [[computer]]s. The subject covers a broad spectrum, from the design and development of an electronic system ([[new product development]]) to assuring its proper function, service life and [[Recycling|disposal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lienig&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=J.

Food is usually of [[plant]] or [[animal]] origin, and contains essential [[nutrient]]s, such as [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, [[protein (nutrient)|proteins]], [[vitamin]]s, or [[Mineral (nutrient)|minerals]]. The substance is [[Ingestion|ingested]] by an [[organism]] and assimilated by the organism's [[Cell (biology)|cells]] to provide [[energy]], maintain life, or stimulate growth.  \n\nHistorically, [[human]]s secured food through two methods: [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] and [[agriculture]], which gave modern humans a mainly [[omnivore|omnivorous]] diet. As agricultural technologies increased, humans settled into agriculture lifestyles with diets shaped by the agriculture opportunities in their geography. Geographic and cultural differences has led to creation of numerous [[cuisine]]s and [[culinary arts]], including a wide array of [[ingredient]]s, [[culinary herb|herbs]], [[spice]]s, [[List of cooking techniques|techniques]], and [[dish (food)|dishes]]. As cultures have mixed through forces like [[international trade]] and [[globalization]], and ingredients have become more widely available beyond their geographic origins, creating an exchange of different food traditions and practices. \n\nToday, the majority of the [[food energy]] required by the ever-[[Population growth|increasing]] [[world population|population of the world]] is supplied by the industrial [[food industry]], which produces food with [[Intensive farming|intensive agriculture]] and redistributes it through complex [[food processing]] and [[food distribution]] systems. This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on [[Fossil fuel|fossil fuels]], which means that the larger food and agricultural system is one of the [[Climate change and agriculture|major contributors to climate change]], accountable for as much as 37% of total [[Greenhouse-gas emissions|greenhouse gas emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Science Advice for Policy by European Academies|url=https://www.sapea.info/wp-content/uploads/sustainable-food-system-report.pdf|title=A sustainable food system for the European Union|publisher=SAPEA|year=2020|isbn=978-3-9820301-7-3|location=Berlin|pages=39|doi=10.26356/sustainablefood|access-date=14 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200418105107/https://www.sapea.info/wp-content/uploads/sustainable-food-system-report.pdf|archive-date=18 April 2020|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing the [[Emission intensity|carbon intensity]] of the [[food system]] and [[food waste]] are [[Climate change mitigation|important mitigation measures]] in the global response to climate change. \n\nThe food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues including: [[sustainability]], [[biological diversity]], [[nutritional economics]], [[population growth]], [[water supply]], and [[Food security|access to food]]. The [[right to food]] is a [[human right]] derived from the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ([[ICESCR]]), recognizing the &quot;right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food&quot;, as well as the &quot;[[Fundamental rights|fundamental right]] to be free from [[hunger]]&quot;.

Many of these plant species have several distinct [[cultivar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, 253.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Seed]]s of plants are a good source of food for animals, including humans, because they contain the nutrients necessary for the plant's initial growth, including many healthful fats, such as [[Omega-3|omega fats]]. In fact, the majority of food consumed by human beings are seed-based foods. Edible seeds include cereals ([[maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[et cetera]]), [[legume]]s ([[bean]]s, [[pea]]s, [[lentil]]s, et cetera), and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]].

However, not all seeds are edible. Large seeds, such as those from a [[lemon]], pose a choking hazard, while seeds from [[cherries]] and [[apple]]s  contain [[cyanide]] which could be poisonous only if consumed in large volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/questions/question/2737/|title=Are apple cores poisonous?|publisher=The Naked Scientists, University of Cambridge|date=26 Sep 2010|accessdate=12 May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506191326/http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/questions/question/2737/|archivedate=6 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Fruit]]s are the ripened ovaries of plants, including the seeds within.

The foods differ substantially from the ingredients found in a typical home kitchen. The primary differences relate to campers' and backpackers' special needs for foods that have appropriate cooking time, perishability, weight, and nutritional content.\n\nTo address these needs, camping food is often made up of either [[freeze-dried]], [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|precooked]] or [[dehydrated]] ingredients. Many campers use a combination of these foods.\n\n[[Freeze-drying]] requires the use of heavy machinery and is not something that most campers are able to do on their own. Freeze-dried ingredients are often considered superior to dehydrated ingredients however because they rehydrate at camp faster and retain more flavor than their dehydrated counterparts. Freeze-dried ingredients take so little time to rehydrate that they can often be eaten without cooking them first and have a texture similar to a crunchy chip.\n\n[[food dehydration|Dehydration]] can reduce the weight of the food by sixty to ninety percent by removing water through evaporation. Some foods dehydrate well, such as onions, peppers, and tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wildernessdining.com/campingfood.html |title=Camping Food FAQs |website= |accessdate=2009-05-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402225612/http://www.wildernessdining.com/campingfood.html |archive-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;urlCamping Food Tips: Backpacking, Hiking &amp; Camping Meals Get Easy.&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hiking-gear-and-equipment-used-for-camping.com/camping-food.html |title=Camping Food Tips: Backpacking, Hiking &amp; Camping Meals Get Easy. |website= |accessdate=2009-05-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422213307/http://www.hiking-gear-and-equipment-used-for-camping.com/camping-food.html |archive-date=2009-04-22 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dehydration often produces a more compact, albeit slightly heavier, end result than freeze-drying.\n\nSurplus precooked military Meals, [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|Meals, Ready-to-Eat]] (MREs) are sometimes used by campers.

A retort pouch is a plastic and metal foil laminate pouch that is used as an alternative to traditional industrial [[canning]] methods.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Diet food ===\n[[File:New KM.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A &quot;low fat&quot; child's meal from [[Burger King]], with &quot;apple fries&quot; replacing fried potato chips, and a serving of [[macaroni and cheese]] as its main dish]]\n{{Main|Diet food}}\n\n[[Diet food]] (or &quot;dietetic food&quot;) refers to any food or beverage whose recipe is altered to reduce fat, carbohydrates, abhor/adhore sugar in order to make it part of a weight loss program or [[Dieting|diet.]] Such foods are usually intended to assist in weight loss or a change in body type, although [[bodybuilding supplements]] are designed to aid in gaining weight or muscle.\n\nThe process of making a diet version of a food usually requires finding an acceptable low-food-energy substitute for some high-food-energy ingredient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/NCCdphp/dnpa/nutrition/pdf/r2p_energy_density.pdf|title=Low-Energy-Dense Foods|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be as simple as replacing some or all of the food's [[sugar]] with a [[sugar substitute]] as is common with diet soft drinks such as [[Coca-Cola]] (for example [[Diet Coke]]). In some snacks, the food may be baked instead of fried thus reducing the food energy. In other cases, low-fat ingredients may be used as replacements.\n\nIn [[whole grain]] foods, the higher fiber content effectively displaces some of the starch components of the flour. Since certain fibers have no food energy, this results in a modest energy reduction. Another technique relies on the intentional addition of other reduced-food-energy ingredients, such as [[resistant starch]] or [[dietary fiber]], to replace part of the flour and achieve a more significant energy reduction.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Finger food ===\n[[File:AfternoonTea.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Tea (meal)#Afternoon tea|Afternoon tea]] finger foods]]\n{{Main|Finger food}}\n\n[[Finger food]] is food meant to be eaten directly using the [[hand]]s, in contrast to food eaten with a [[knife]] and [[fork]], [[spoon]], [[chopsticks]], or other [[cutlery|utensils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Finger Food|author=Kay Halsey|year=1999|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=978-962-593-444-0|url=https://archive.org/details/fingerfood00hals}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cultures, food is almost always eaten with the hands; for example, [[Ethiopian cuisine]] is eaten by rolling various dishes up in ''[[injera]]'' [[bread]].&lt;ref&gt;J.H.

Examples of these are miniature meat pies, [[sausage roll]]s, sausages on sticks, cheese and olives on sticks, chicken drumsticks or [[Buffalo wing|wings]], [[spring roll]]s, miniature [[quiche]]s, [[samosa]]s, [[sandwich]]es, Merenda or other such based foods, such as [[pita]]s or items in [[buns]], [[bhajji]]s, [[potato wedges]], [[vol au vent]]s, several other such small items and [[risotto]] balls ([[arancini]]). Other well-known foods that are generally eaten with the hands include [[hamburger]]s, [[pizza]], [[Chips (hot food)|Chips]], [[hot dog]]s, [[fruit]] and [[bread]].\n\nIn East Asia, foods like pancakes or flatbreads (''bing'' \u997c) and street foods such as [[chuanr|chuan]] (\u4e32, also pronounced ''chuan'') are often eaten with the hands.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Fresh food ===\n[[File:Culinary fruits front view.jpg|thumb|150px|Fresh fruits.]]\n{{Main|Fresh food}}\n\n[[Fresh food]] is food which has not been [[food preservation|preserved]] and has not [[food spoilage|spoiled]] yet.

Artificial sweeteners such as [[sucralose]] are used to mimic the sugar molecule, creating the sensation of sweet, without the calories. Other types of sugar include [[raw sugar]], which is known for its amber color, as it is unprocessed. As sugar is vital for energy and survival, the taste of sugar is pleasant.\n\nThe [[stevia]] plant contains a compound known as [[steviol]] which, when extracted, has 300 times the sweetness of sugar while having minimal impact on blood sugar.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--note--&gt;The [[sweetness]] multiplier &quot;300 times&quot; comes from [http://www.science.edu.sg/ssc/detailed.jsp?artid=67&amp;type=6&amp;root=3&amp;parent=3&amp;cat=30 subjective evaluations by a panel of test subjects] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123124043/http://www.science.edu.sg/ssc/detailed.jsp?artid=67&amp;type=6&amp;root=3&amp;parent=3&amp;cat=30 |date=January 23, 2009 }} tasting various dilutions compared to a standard dilution of [[sucrose]]. Sources referenced in this article say steviosides have up to 250 times the sweetness of sucrose, but others, including stevioside brands such as SweetLeaf, claim 300 times. 1/3 to 1/2 teaspoon (1.6\u20132.5 ml) of stevioside powder is claimed to have equivalent sweetening power to 1 cup (237 ml) of sugar.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Sour===\n\nSourness is caused by the taste of [[acid]]s, such as [[vinegar]] in alcoholic beverages. Sour foods include [[citrus]], specifically [[lemon]]s, [[Lime (fruit)|limes]], and to a lesser degree [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]]. Sour is evolutionarily significant as it is a sign for a food that may have gone [[rancidity|rancid]] due to bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;States &quot;having an acid taste like lemon or vinegar: she sampled the wine and found it was sour. (of food, esp. milk) spoiled because of fermentation.&quot; New Oxford American Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Many foods, however, are slightly acidic, and help stimulate the taste buds and enhance flavor.\n\n===Salty===\n[[File:Piles of Salt Salar de Uyuni Bolivia Luca Galuzzi 2006 a.jpg|thumb|Salt mounds in [[Bolivia]]]]\n\n[[Saltiness]] is the taste of [[alkali metal]] [[ions]] such as [[sodium]] and [[potassium]]. It is found in almost every food in low to moderate proportions to enhance flavor, although to eat pure salt is regarded as highly unpleasant. There are many different types of salt, with each having a different degree of saltiness, including [[sea salt]], [[fleur de sel]], [[kosher salt]], mined salt, and grey salt. Other than enhancing flavor, its significance is that the body needs and maintains a delicate [[electrolyte]] balance, which is the [[kidney]]'s function. Salt may be iodized, meaning [[iodine]] has been added to it, a necessary nutrient that promotes [[thyroid]] function. Some canned foods, notably [[soup]]s or packaged [[broth]]s, tend to be high in salt as a means of preserving the food longer. Historically salt has long been used as a meat preservative as salt promotes water excretion. Similarly, dried foods also promote food safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chemistryexplained.com/Fe-Ge/Food-Preservatives.html|title=Food Preservatives|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513045432/http://www.chemistryexplained.com/Fe-Ge/Food-Preservatives.html|archivedate=13 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Bitter===\n\n[[Bitter (taste)|Bitterness]] is a sensation often considered unpleasant characterized by having a sharp, pungent taste.

Other differences include preferences (hot or cold, spicy, etc.) and practices, the study of which is known as [[gastronomy]]. Many cultures have diversified their foods by means of preparation, cooking methods, and manufacturing. This also includes a complex food trade which helps the cultures to economically survive by way of food, not just by consumption.\n\nSome popular types of ethnic foods include [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], [[French cuisine|French]], [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Cuisine of the United States|American]], [[Cajun cuisine|Cajun]], [[Thai cuisine|Thai]], [[African cuisine|African]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] and [[Nepalese cuisine|Nepalese]]. Various cultures throughout the world study the dietary analysis of food [[Habit (psychology)|habits]]. While [[evolution]]arily speaking, as opposed to culturally, humans are [[omnivore]]s, religion and social constructs such as [[morality]], [[activism]], or [[environmentalism]] will often affect which foods they will consume. Food is eaten and typically enjoyed through the sense of [[taste]], the perception of flavor from eating and drinking. Certain tastes are more enjoyable than others, for evolutionary purposes.\n\n===Presentation===\n[[File:Terrine de saumon au basilic.JPG|thumb|left|A French basil salmon [[terrine (food)|terrine]], with eye-appealing [[Garnish (food)|garnishes]]]]\n{{Main|Food presentation}}\nAesthetically pleasing and eye-appealing food presentations can encourage people to consume foods. A common saying is that people &quot;eat with their eyes&quot;. Food presented in a clean and appetizing way will encourage a good flavor, even if unsatisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brain-food.org/blog/you-first-eat-with-your-eyes |title=You first eat with your eyes |publisher= |accessdate=29 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529203250/http://www.brain-food.org/blog/you-first-eat-with-your-eyes |archivedate=29 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Food Texture, Andrew J. Rosenthal&quot;&gt;Food Texture, Andrew J. Rosenthal&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Texture (food)|Texture]] plays a crucial role in the enjoyment of eating foods. Contrasts in textures, such as something crunchy in an otherwise smooth dish, may increase the appeal of eating it. Common examples include adding [[granola]] to [[yogurt]], adding [[crouton]]s to a [[salad]] or [[soup]], and toasting bread to enhance its crunchiness for a smooth topping, such as jam or butter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aJBIbvClWfcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Food+texture#v=onepage | title = Food Texture: Measurement and Perception | isbn = 978-0-8342-1238-1 | last1 = Rosenthal | first1 = Andrew J | date = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAnother universal phenomenon regarding food is the appeal of contrast in taste and presentation. For example, such opposite flavors as [[sweetness]] and [[saltiness]] tend to go well together, as in [[kettle corn]] and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]].\n\n===Food preparation===\n{{Main|Outline of food preparation}}\nWhile many foods can be eaten raw, many also undergo some form of preparation for reasons of safety, [[palatability]], [[Mouthfeel|texture]], or [[flavor]]. At the simplest level this may involve washing, cutting, trimming, or adding other foods or ingredients, such as spices. It may also involve mixing, heating or cooling, [[pressure cooking]], fermentation, or combination with other food. In a home, most food preparation takes place in a [[kitchen]]. Some preparation is done to enhance the [[taste]] or aesthetic appeal; other preparation may help to [[Food preservation|preserve]] the food; others may be involved in cultural identity. A [[meal]] is made up of food which is prepared to be eaten at a specific time and place.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, 11\u201319&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[File:LG refrigerator interior.jpg|thumb|A refrigerator helps to keep foods fresh.]]\n\n====Animal preparation====\nThe preparation of animal-based food usually involves [[Slaughter (livestock)|slaughter]], [[evisceration (organ removal)|evisceration]], hanging, portioning, and [[Rendering (food processing)|rendering]]. In developed countries, this is usually done outside the home in [[slaughterhouses]], which are used to process animals en masse for meat production. Many countries regulate their slaughterhouses by law. For example, the United States has established the [[Humane Slaughter Act]] of 1958, which requires that an animal be stunned before killing. This act, like those in many countries, exempts slaughter in accordance with religious law, such as [[kosher]], [[shechita]], and [[dhab\u012b\u1e25ah]] halal. Strict interpretations of [[kashrut]] require the animal to be fully aware when its carotid artery is cut.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, 142\u201343.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOn the local level, a butcher may commonly break down larger animal meat into smaller manageable cuts, and pre-wrap them for commercial sale or wrap them to order in butcher paper. In addition, fish and [[seafood]] may be fabricated into smaller cuts by a fishmonger. However, fish butchery may be done onboard a fishing vessel and quick-frozen for the preservation of quality.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, 202\u201306&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====Raw food preparation{{anchor|Raw Food Preparation}}====\n[[File:2007feb-sushi-odaiba-manytypes.jpg|thumb|left|Many types of [[fish]] ready to be eaten, including [[salmon]] and [[tuna]]]]\n\nCertain cultures highlight animal and vegetable foods in a [[Raw foodism|raw state]]. [[Salad]]s consisting of raw vegetables or fruits are common in many cuisines. [[Sashimi]] in [[Japanese cuisine]] consists of raw sliced [[fish]] or other meat, and [[sushi]] often incorporates raw fish or seafood. [[Steak tartare]] and salmon tartare are dishes made from diced or ground raw beef or salmon, mixed with various ingredients and served with [[baguette]]s, [[brioche]], or [[frites]].&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, 786\u201387.&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, [[carpaccio]] is a dish of very thinly sliced raw [[beef]], drizzled with a [[vinaigrette]] made with olive oil.&lt;ref&gt;Robuchon, 224.&lt;/ref&gt; The health food movement known as [[raw foodism]] promotes a mostly [[vegan]] diet of raw fruits, vegetables, and grains prepared in various ways, including juicing, food dehydration, sprouting, and other methods of preparation that do not heat the food above {{convert|118|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|sigfig=3}}.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, 656&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a raw meat dish is [[ceviche]], a Latin American dish made with raw meat that is &quot;cooked&quot; from the highly acidic citric juice from lemons and limes along with other aromatics such as garlic.\n====Cooking====\n[[File:Wok cooking and the heat source by The Pocket in Nanjing.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Cooking with a [[wok]] in China]]\n{{Main|Cooking}}\n\nThe term &quot;cooking&quot; encompasses a vast range of methods, tools, and combinations of ingredients to improve the flavor or digestibility of food. Cooking technique, known as [[culinary art]], generally requires the selection, measurement, and combining of ingredients in an ordered procedure in an effort to achieve the desired result. Constraints on success include the variability of ingredients, ambient conditions, [[tool]]s, and the skill of the individual cook.&lt;ref&gt;McGee Chapter 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity of cooking worldwide is a reflection of the myriad nutritional, aesthetic, agricultural, economic, cultural, and religious considerations that affect it.&lt;ref name=&quot;silhnc&quot;&gt;Mead, 11\u201319.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCooking requires applying heat to a food which usually, though not always, chemically changes the molecules, thus changing its flavor, [[Mouthfeel|texture]], appearance, and nutritional properties.&lt;ref&gt;McGee&lt;/ref&gt; Cooking certain proteins, such as egg whites, meats, and fish, denatures the protein, causing it to firm. There is archaeological evidence of roasted foodstuffs at ''[[Homo erectus]]'' campsites dating from 420,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Boiling as a means of cooking requires a container, and has been practiced at least since the 10th millennium BC with the introduction of [[pottery]].&lt;ref&gt;McGee, 784.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=====Cooking equipment=====\n[[File:Pfanne (Edelstahl).jpg|thumb|A [[stainless steel]] [[frying pan]]]]\n[[File:TraditionalAsado.jpg|thumb|A traditional [[asado]] (barbecue)]]\n{{Main|Cookware and bakeware}}\n\nThere are many different types of equipment used for cooking.\n\n[[Oven]]s are mostly hollow devices that get very hot (up to {{convert|500|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}) and are used for baking or roasting and offer a dry-heat cooking method. Different cuisines will use different types of ovens. For example, Indian culture uses a [[tandoor]] oven, which is a cylindrical clay oven which operates at a single high temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, 782\u201383&lt;/ref&gt; Western kitchens use variable temperature [[convection oven]]s, conventional ovens, [[toaster oven]]s, or non-radiant heat ovens like the [[microwave oven]]. Classic Italian cuisine includes the use of a brick oven containing burning wood. Ovens may be wood-fired, coal-fired, [[natural gas|gas]], electric, or oil-fired.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, 539,784.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nVarious types of cook-tops are used as well. They carry the same variations of fuel types as the ovens mentioned above. Cook-tops are used to heat vessels placed on top of the heat source, such as a [[saut\u00e9 pan]], sauce pot, [[frying pan]], or [[pressure cooker]]. These pieces of equipment can use either a moist or dry cooking method and include methods such as [[steam]]ing, [[simmer]]ing, [[boiling]], and [[Poaching (cooking)|poaching]] for moist methods, while the dry methods include [[saut\u00e9]]ing, [[pan fry]]ing, and [[deep-fry]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, 771\u201391&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn addition, many cultures use grills for cooking. A [[Grill (cooking)|grill]] operates with a radiant heat source from below, usually covered with a metal grid and sometimes a cover. An open-pit barbecue in the American south is one example along with the American style outdoor grill fueled by wood, liquid propane, or charcoal along with soaked wood chips for smoking.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, 356.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]] style of barbecue is called [[barbacoa]], which involves the cooking of meats such as whole sheep over an open fire. In Argentina, an [[asado]] (Spanish for &quot;grilled&quot;) is prepared on a grill held over an open pit or fire made upon the ground, on which a whole animal or smaller cuts are grilled.&lt;ref&gt;Asado Argentina&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Restaurants===\n[[File:Inside Le Procope.jpg|thumb|right|[[Caf\u00e9 Procope]] in Paris was founded in 1686]]\n[[File:Allyn House restaurant menu (March 5, 1859).jpg|thumb|The Allyn House restaurant menu (March 5, 1859)]]\n{{Main|Restaurant}}\n\nRestaurants employ [[chef]]s to prepare the food, and [[waiting staff|waiters]] to serve customers at the table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/restaurant|work=collinsdictionary.com|title=Definition of 'restaurant'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term restaurant comes from an old term for a restorative [[broth|meat broth]]; this broth (or bouillon) was served in elegant outlets in Paris from the mid 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/restaurant|work=etymonline.com|title=restaurant (n.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; These refined &quot;restaurants&quot; were a marked change from the usual basic eateries such as inns and taverns,&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.unlv.edu/collections/menus/history-restaurant|work=digital.library.unlv.edu|title=The History of the Restaurant}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some had developed from early [[Parisian caf\u00e9]]s, such as [[Caf\u00e9 Procope]], by first serving bouillon, then adding other cooked food to their menus.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, 660\u201361.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCommercial eateries existed during the [[Roman period]], with evidence of 150 &quot;thermopolia&quot;, a form of fast food restaurant, found in [[Pompeii]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/pompeii/9850077/Pompeii-exhibition-the-food-and-drink-of-the-ancient-Roman-cities.html|work=telegraph.co.uk|title=Pompeii exhibition: the food and drink of the ancient Roman cities|author=Bee Wilson|date=3 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and urban sales of prepared foods may have existed in [[China]] during the [[Song dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=A Culinary Legacy from the Song Dynasty|last=|first=|date=11 September 2014|work=Shanghai Daily|access-date=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn 2005, the population of the United States spent $496 billion on out-of-home dining.

This can be as simple as a [[butcher]] preparing meat, or as complex as a modern international [[food industry]]. Early food processing techniques were limited by available food preservation, packaging, and transportation. This mainly involved [[salting (food)|salting]], [[Curing (food preservation)|curing]], curdling, [[drying (food)|drying]], [[pickling]], [[fermentation (food)|fermenting]], and [[smoking (food)|smoking]].&lt;ref&gt;Aguilera, 1\u20133.&lt;/ref&gt; Food manufacturing arose during the [[industrial revolution]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This development took advantage of new [[Mass-marketing|mass markets]] and emerging technology, such as [[Mill (grinding)|milling]], preservation, [[packaging]] and [[Packaging and labeling|labeling]], and transportation. It brought the advantages of pre-prepared time-saving food to the bulk of ordinary people who did not employ domestic servants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jango&quot;&gt;Jango-Cohen&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAt the start of the 21st century, a two-tier structure has arisen, with a few international food processing giants controlling a wide range of well-known food brands. There also exists a wide array of small local or national food processing companies.&lt;ref&gt;Hannaford&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced technologies have also come to change food manufacture. Computer-based control systems, sophisticated [[Food processing|processing]] and packaging methods, and [[logistics]] and [[food distribution|distribution]] advances can enhance product quality, improve [[food safety]], and reduce costs.&lt;ref name=Jango/&gt;\n\n===International food imports and exports===\n{{see also|Population density}}\nThe [[World Bank]] reported that the European Union was the top food importer in 2005, followed at a distance by the US and Japan. [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s need for food was especially well-illustrated in [[World War II]].  Despite the implementation of [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|food rationing]], Britain remained dependent on food imports and the result was a long term engagement in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].\n\nFood is traded and marketed on a global basis. The variety and availability of food is no longer restricted by the diversity of locally grown food or the limitations of the local growing season.&lt;ref&gt;The Economic Research Service of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1961 and 1999, there was a 400% increase in worldwide food exports.&lt;ref&gt;Regmi&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries are now economically dependent on food exports, which in some cases account for over 80% of all exports.&lt;ref&gt;[[CIA World Factbook]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn 1994, over 100 countries became signatories to the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] in a dramatic increase in [[trade liberalization]]. This included an agreement to reduce subsidies paid to farmers, underpinned by the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] enforcement of [[Agricultural policy|agricultural subsidy]], [[Tax, tariff, and trade|tariffs]], import [[Quota Share|quotas]], and settlement of trade disputes that cannot be bilaterally resolved.&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organization, The Uruguay Round&lt;/ref&gt; Where trade barriers are raised on the disputed grounds of public health and safety, the WTO refer the dispute to the [[Codex Alimentarius]] Commission, which was founded in 1962 by the [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] and the World Health Organization.

The marketing of even a single food product can be a complicated process involving many producers and companies. For example, fifty-six companies are involved in making one [[canning|can]] of chicken noodle soup. These businesses include not only chicken and vegetable processors but also the companies that transport the ingredients and those who print labels and manufacture cans.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 501\u201303.&lt;/ref&gt; The food marketing system is the largest direct and indirect non-government employer in the United States.\n\nIn the pre-modern era, the sale of surplus food took place once a week when farmers took their wares on market day into the local village marketplace. Here food was sold to [[grocer]]s for sale in their local shops for purchase by local consumers.&lt;ref name=&quot;silhnc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jango/&gt; With the onset of industrialization and the development of the food processing industry, a wider range of food could be sold and distributed in distant locations. Typically early grocery shops would be counter-based shops, in which purchasers told the shop-keeper what they wanted, so that the shop-keeper could get it for them.&lt;ref name=&quot;silhnc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benson&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the 20th century, [[supermarket]]s were born. Supermarkets brought with them a [[self service]] approach to shopping using [[shopping cart]]s, and were able to offer quality food at lower cost through [[economies of scale]] and reduced staffing costs. In the latter part of the 20th century, this has been further revolutionized by the development of vast warehouse-sized, out-of-town supermarkets, selling a wide range of food from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Humphery&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nUnlike food processors, food retailing is a two-tier market in which a small number of very large [[Corporation|companies]] control a large proportion of supermarkets. The supermarket giants wield great purchasing power over farmers and processors, and strong influence over consumers. Nevertheless, less than 10% of consumer spending on food goes to farmers, with larger percentages going to [[advertising]], transportation, and intermediate corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff, Fred (Ed.) &quot;[T]he farmer's share of the food dollar (after paying for input costs) has steadily declined from about 40 percent in 1910 to less than 10 percent in 1990.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Prices===\n[[File:GrainProducts.jpg|thumb|right|Some essential food products including [[bread]], [[rice]] and [[pasta]]]]\n{{See also|Food prices|}}\n\n[[File:Annual real food price indices.svg|thumb|Food, meat, dairy, cereals, vegetable oil, and sugar price indices, deflated using the World Bank Manufactures Unit Value Index (MUV)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual real food price indices|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/worldfood/Reports_and_docs/Food_price_indices_data.xls|accessdate=19 March 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401183726/http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/worldfood/Reports_and_docs/Food_price_indices_data.xls|archivedate=1 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]\nIt is rare for price spikes to hit all major foods in most countries at once, but [[food prices]] suffered all-time peaks in 2008 and 2011, posting a 15% and 12% deflated increase year-over-year, representing prices higher than any data collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAO food prices index|url=http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/|website=FAO.org|accessdate=25 Feb 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180224070948/http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/|archivedate=24 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the increase in food prices may be the [[2000s energy crisis|increase in oil prices]] at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0118/p08s01-comv.html |title=The global grain bubble |work=Christian Science Monitor |date=18 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/10/opinion/10thu1.html | work=The New York Times | title=The World Food Crisis | date=10 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn December 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls.

The past five years have seen rapid growth in the contribution of Asian nations to the global fluid and powdered milk manufacturing industry, which in 2008 accounted for more than 30% of production, while China alone accounts for more than 10% of both production and consumption in the global fruit and vegetable processing and preserving industry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ibisworld.com/media/2014/07/02/serving-diversity-major-trends-food-services-sector/ May 2008, Global Trends: \u2013 Food Production and Consumption: The China Effect] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231060513/http://www.ibisworld.com/media/2014/07/02/serving-diversity-major-trends-food-services-sector/ |date=2014-12-31 }}, ''IBISWorld''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn 2013 [[Overseas Development Institute]] researchers showed that [[rice]] has more than doubled in price since 2000, rising by 120% in real terms. This was as a result of shifts in trade policy and restocking by major producers. More fundamental drivers of increased prices are the higher costs of fertilizer, diesel, and labor. Parts of Asia see rural wages rise with potential large benefits for the 1.3 billion (2008 estimate) of Asia's poor in reducing the poverty they face. However, this negatively impacts more vulnerable groups who don't share in the economic boom, especially in Asian and African coastal cities. The researchers said the threat means social-protection policies are needed to guard against price shocks. The research proposed that in the longer run, the rises present opportunities to export for Western African farmers with high potential for rice production to replace imports with domestic production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/7687-end-cheap-rice-prices-rural-labour-wages Steve Wiggins and Sharada Keats, August 2013,  The end of cheap rice: a cause for celebration?

This has caused price fluctuations which are not strongly related to the actual supply of food, according to the United Nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ind&quot; /&gt; Financial institutions now make up 61% of all investment in [[wheat]] futures. According to [[Olivier De Schutter]], the UN special rapporteur on food, there was a rush by institutions to enter the food market following [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Commodities Futures Modernization Act]] of 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ind&quot; /&gt; De Schutter told the Independent in March 2012: &quot;What we are seeing now is that these financial markets have developed massively with the arrival of these new financial investors, who are purely interested in the short-term monetary gain and are not really interested in the physical thing \u2013 they never actually buy the ton of wheat or [[maize]]; they only buy a promise to buy or to sell. The result of this financialization of the commodities market is that the prices of the products respond increasingly to a purely [[food speculation|speculative]] logic. This explains why in very short periods of time we see prices spiking or [[financial bubble|bubbles]] exploding because prices are less and less determined by the real match between supply and demand.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ind&quot; /&gt; In 2011, 450 economists from around the world called on the [[G20]] to regulate the commodities market more.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ind&quot; /&gt;\n\nSome experts have said that speculation has merely aggravated other factors, such as [[climate change]], competition with [[bio-fuels]] and overall rising demand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ind&quot; /&gt; However, some such as [[Jayati Ghosh]], professor of economics at [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]] in [[New Delhi]], have pointed out that prices have increased irrespective of supply and demand issues: Ghosh points to world wheat prices, which doubled in the period from June to December 2010, despite there being no fall in global supply.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ind&quot; /&gt;\n\n==Problems==\n[[File:USDA MyPlate green.svg|thumb|[[MyPlate]] replaced [[MyPyramid]] as the [[USDA]] nutrition guide.]]\nBecause of its centrality to human life, problems related to access, quality and production of food effect every aspect of human life. \n\n=== Nutrition and dietary problems ===\nBetween the extremes of optimal health and death from [[starvation]] or [[malnutrition]], there is an array of disease states that can be caused or alleviated by changes in diet. Deficiencies, excesses, and imbalances in diet can produce negative impacts on health, which may lead to various health problems such as [[scurvy]], [[obesity]], or [[osteoporosis]], [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes]], [[cardiovascular diseases]] as well as psychological and behavioral problems. The science of nutrition attempts to understand how and why specific dietary aspects influence health.\n\nNutrients in food are grouped into several categories. Macronutrients are fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Micronutrients are the [[Mineral (nutrient)|minerals]] and [[vitamins]]. Additionally, food contains water and [[dietary fiber]].\n\nAs previously discussed, the body is designed by [[natural selection]] to enjoy sweet and fattening foods for evolutionary diets, ideal for [[Hunter-gatherer|hunters and gatherers]]. Thus, sweet and fattening foods in nature are typically rare and are very pleasurable to eat. In modern times, with [[biotechnology|advanced technology]], enjoyable foods are easily available to consumers. Unfortunately, this promotes [[obesity]] in adults and children alike.\n\n=== Hunger and starvation ===\nFood deprivation leads to malnutrition and ultimately [[starvation]]. This is often connected with [[famine]], which involves the absence of food in entire communities. This can have a devastating and widespread effect on human health and mortality. [[Rationing]] is sometimes used to distribute food in times of shortage, most notably during times of war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Messer&quot;/&gt;\n\nStarvation is a significant international problem. Approximately 815 million people are undernourished, and over 16,000 children die per day from hunger-related causes.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Health Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt; Food deprivation is regarded as a deficit need in [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] and is measured using [[famine scales]].&lt;ref&gt;Howe, 353\u201372&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== Food waste ===\n{{Excerpt|food waste}}\n\n== Policy ==\n{{Excerpt|Food policy}}\n\n===Legal definition===\nSome countries list a legal definition of food, often referring them with the word ''foodstuff''. These countries list food as any item that is to be processed, partially processed, or unprocessed for consumption. The listing of items included as food includes any substance intended to be, or reasonably expected to be, ingested by humans. In addition to these foodstuffs, drink, [[chewing gum]], water, or other items processed into said food items are part of the legal definition of food. Items not included in the legal definition of food include [[Pet food|animal feed]], live animals (unless being prepared for sale in a market), plants prior to harvesting, medicinal products, [[cosmetics]], [[tobacco]] and tobacco products, [[narcotic]] or [[psychotropic substance]]s, and residues and contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;[[United Kingdom]] [[Office of Public Sector Information]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== Right to food ===\n{{Excerpt|Right to food}}\n\n=== Food security ===\n{{Excerpt|Food security}}\n\n===International aid===\n{{main|Food aid}}\n[[Food aid]] can benefit people suffering from a shortage of food.

Sometimes a cycle of food aid dependence can develop.&lt;ref&gt;Shah&lt;/ref&gt; Its provision, or threatened withdrawal, is sometimes used as a political tool to influence the policies of the destination country, a strategy known as [[food politics]]. Sometimes, food aid provisions will require certain types of food be purchased from certain sellers, and food aid can be misused to enhance the markets of donor countries.&lt;ref&gt;Kripke&lt;/ref&gt; International efforts to distribute food to the neediest countries are often coordinated by the [[World Food Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations World Food program&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Safety==\n{{Main|Food safety}}\n[[File:SalmonellaNIAID.jpg|thumb|left|[[Salmonella]] bacteria is a common cause of foodborne illness, particularly in undercooked [[chicken]] and [[chicken egg]]s.]]\n&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:HACCP Seven Principles.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points ([[HACCP]]) Flowchart]] --&gt;\n\n[[Foodborne illness]], commonly called &quot;food poisoning&quot;, is caused by [[bacteria]], [[toxin]]s, [[virus]]es, [[parasite]]s, and [[prion]]s. Roughly 7 million people die of food poisoning each year, with about 10 times as many suffering from a non-fatal version.&lt;ref name=MedlinePlus&gt;[[National Institute of Health]], MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; The two most common factors leading to cases of bacterial foodborne illness are cross-contamination of ready-to-eat food from other uncooked foods and improper temperature control. Less commonly, acute adverse reactions can also occur if chemical contamination of food occurs, for example from improper storage, or use of non-food grade soaps and disinfectants. Food can also be adulterated by a very wide range of articles (known as &quot;foreign bodies&quot;) during farming, manufacture, cooking, packaging, distribution, or sale. These foreign bodies can include pests or their droppings, hairs, cigarette butts, wood chips, and all manner of other contaminants. It is possible for certain types of food to become contaminated if stored or presented in an unsafe container, such as a ceramic pot with lead-based glaze.&lt;ref name=MedlinePlus/&gt;\n\n[[Food poisoning]] has been recognized as a disease since as early as Hippocrates.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hippocrates]], [[s:On acute diseases|On Acute Diseases]].&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of [[Rancidity|rancid]], contaminated, or adulterated food was commonplace until the introduction of [[hygiene]], refrigeration, and vermin controls in the 19th century. Discovery of techniques for killing bacteria using heat, and other [[microbiological]] studies by scientists such as [[Louis Pasteur]], contributed to the modern sanitation standards that are ubiquitous in developed nations today. This was further underpinned by the work of [[Justus von Liebig]], which led to the development of modern [[food storage]] and [[food preservation]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;Magner, 243\u2013498&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent years, a greater understanding of the causes of food-borne illnesses has led to the development of more systematic approaches such as the [[Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points]] ([[HACCP]]), which can identify and eliminate many risks.&lt;ref&gt;USDA&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nRecommended measures for ensuring food safety include maintaining a clean preparation area with foods of different types kept separate, ensuring an adequate cooking temperature, and refrigerating foods promptly after cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/basics/index.html|title=Check Your Steps|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521002552/http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/basics/index.html|archivedate=21 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nFoods that spoil easily, such as [[meats]], [[dairy]], and [[seafood]], must be prepared a certain way to avoid contaminating the people for whom they are prepared. As such, the rule of thumb is that cold foods (such as dairy products) should be kept cold and hot foods (such as soup) should be kept hot until storage. Cold meats, such as chicken, that are to be cooked should not be placed at room temperature for thawing, at the risk of dangerous bacterial growth, such as ''[[Salmonella]]'' or ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Chicken_Food_Safety_Focus/index.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040519004032/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Chicken_Food_Safety_Focus/index.asp|archivedate=2004-05-19|title=Fact sheets - Poultry Preparation - Focus on Chicken}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Allergies===\n{{Main|Food allergy}}\nSome people have [[allergies]] or sensitivities to foods that are not problematic to most people. This occurs when a person's [[immune system]] mistakes a certain food protein for a harmful foreign agent and attacks it. About 2% of adults and 8% of children have a food allergy.&lt;ref name=allergy&gt;[[National Institute of Health]]&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of the food substance required to provoke a reaction in a particularly susceptible individual can be quite small. In some instances, traces of food in the air, too minute to be perceived through smell, have been known to provoke lethal reactions in extremely sensitive individuals. Common food allergens are [[gluten]], [[maize|corn]], [[shellfish]] (mollusks), [[peanut]]s, and [[soy]].&lt;ref name=allergy/&gt; Allergens frequently produce symptoms such as [[diarrhea]], [[rash]]es, bloating, [[vomiting]], and [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]]. The digestive complaints usually develop within half an hour of ingesting the [[allergen]].&lt;ref name=allergy/&gt;\n\nRarely, food allergies can lead to a [[medical emergency]], such as [[anaphylactic shock]], [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure), and loss of consciousness. An allergen associated with this type of reaction is peanut, although [[latex]] products can induce similar reactions.&lt;ref name=allergy/&gt; Initial treatment is with [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline), often carried by known patients in the form of an [[Epi-pen]] or [[Twinject]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epipen.com/epipen_main.aspx About Epipen], Epipen.com {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106164129/http://www.epipen.com/epipen_main.aspx |date=January 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twinject.com/ About Twinject], Twinject.com&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Other health issues===\nHuman diet was estimated to cause perhaps around 35% of [[Diet and cancer|cancers]] in a human epidemiological analysis by [[Richard Doll]] and [[Richard Peto]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Doll | first1 = R. | last2 = Peto | first2 = R. | title = The causes of cancer: Quantitative estimates of avoidable risks of cancer in the United States today | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 66 | issue = 6 | pages = 1191\u20131308 | year = 1981 | pmid = 7017215 | doi=10.1093/jnci/66.6.1192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These cancer may be caused by [[carcinogen]]s that are present in food naturally or as contaminants. Food contaminated with fungal growth may contain [[mycotoxin]]s such as [[aflatoxins]] which may be found in contaminated corn and peanuts.  Other carcinogens identified in food include [[heterocyclic amine]]s generated in meat when cooked at high temperature, [[polyaromatic hydrocarbon]]s in charred meat and smoked fish, and [[nitrosamine]]s generated from nitrites used as food preservatives in [[cured meat]] such as [[bacon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;carcinogens and anticarcinogens&quot;/&gt;\n\n[[Anticarcinogen]]s that may help prevent cancer can also be found in many food especially fruit and vegetables. [[Antioxidant]]s are important groups of compounds that may help remove potentially harmful chemicals. It is however often difficult to identify the specific components in diet that serve to increase or decrease cancer risk since many food, such as beef steak and broccoli, contain low concentrations of both carcinogens and anticarcinogens.&lt;ref name=&quot;carcinogens and anticarcinogens&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Carcinogens and Anticarcinogens in the Human Diet |url=https://archive.org/details/carcinogensantic0000nati |url-access=registration |publisher=National Academy Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-309-05391-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\nThere are many international certifications in the cooking field, such as [[Monde Selection]], A.A.

Among other activities ISOC provides an administrative home for a number of less formally organized groups that are involved in developing and managing the Internet, including: the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), [[Internet Architecture Board]] (IAB), [[Internet Engineering Steering Group]] (IESG), [[Internet Research Task Force]] (IRTF), and [[Internet Research Steering Group]] (IRSG). On 16 November 2005, the United Nations-sponsored [[World Summit on the Information Society]] in [[Tunis]] established the [[Internet Governance Forum]] (IGF) to discuss Internet-related issues.\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n{{See also|List of countries by number of Internet users|List of countries by Internet connection speeds}}\n[[File:World map of submarine cables.png|thumb|2007 map showing submarine fiberoptic telecommunication cables around the world.]]\nThe communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture. As with any computer network, the Internet physically consists of [[router (computing)|router]]s, media (such as cabling and radio links), repeaters, modems etc. However, as an example of [[internetworking]], many of the network nodes are not necessarily internet equipment per se, the internet packets are carried by other full-fledged networking protocols with the Internet acting as a homogeneous networking standard, running across [[heterogeneous]] hardware, with the packets guided to their destinations by IP routers.\n\n=== Routing and service tiers ===\n[[File:Internet Connectivity Distribution &amp; Core.svg|thumb|Packet routing across the Internet involves several tiers of Internet service providers.]]\n\n[[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) establish the worldwide connectivity between individual networks at various levels of scope. End-users who only access the Internet when needed to perform a function or obtain information, represent the bottom of the routing hierarchy. At the top of the routing hierarchy are the [[tier 1 network]]s, large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via very high speed [[fibre optic cable]]s and governed by [[peering]] agreements. [[Tier 2 network|Tier 2]] and lower level networks buy [[Internet transit]] from other providers to reach at least some parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in peering. An ISP may use a single upstream provider for connectivity, or implement [[multihoming]] to achieve redundancy and load balancing. [[Internet exchange point]]s are major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs. Large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises, and governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks. Research networks tend to interconnect with large subnetworks such as [[GEANT]], [[GLORIAD]], [[Internet2]], and the UK's [[national research and education network]], [[JANET]]. Both the Internet IP routing structure and hypertext links of the World Wide Web are examples of [[scale-free network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal\n |last1=A. L. Barab'asi\n |first1=R.

Routing tables are maintained by manual configuration or automatically by [[routing protocol]]s. End-nodes typically use a [[default route]] that points toward an ISP providing transit, while ISP routers use the [[Border Gateway Protocol]] to establish the most efficient routing across the complex connections of the global Internet.\n\n=== Access ===\nCommon methods of [[Internet access]] by users include dial-up with a computer [[modem]] via telephone circuits, [[Broadband Internet access|broadband]] over [[coaxial cable]], [[Optical fiber|fiber optics]] or copper wires, [[Wi-Fi]], [[Satellite Internet|satellite]], and [[mobile telephony|cellular telephone]] technology (e.g. [[3G]], [[4G]]). The Internet may often be accessed from computers in libraries and [[Internet cafe]]s. [[Internet kiosk|Internet access points]] exist in many public places such as airport halls and coffee shops. Various terms are used, such as ''public Internet kiosk'', ''public access terminal'', and ''Web [[payphone]]''. Many hotels also have public terminals that are usually fee-based. These terminals are widely accessed for various usages, such as ticket booking, bank deposit, or online payment. Wi-Fi provides wireless access to the Internet via local computer networks. [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|Hotspots]] providing such access include [[Wi-Fi#Internet access|Wi-Fi cafes]], where users need to bring their own wireless devices such as a laptop or [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]]. These services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based.\n\n[[Grassroots]] efforts have led to [[wireless community network]]s. Commercial Wi-Fi services that cover large areas are available in many cities, such as [[New York City|New York]], [[London]], [[Vienna]], [[Toronto]], [[San Francisco]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Chicago]] and [[Pittsburgh]], where the Internet can then be accessed from places such as a park bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pasternak |first=Sean B. |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000082&amp;sid=aQ0ZfhMa4XGQ |title=Toronto Hydro to Install Wireless Network in Downtown Toronto |publisher=Bloomberg |date=7 March 2006 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060410104717/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000082&amp;sid=aQ0ZfhMa4XGQ |archivedate=10 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments have also been conducted with proprietary mobile wireless networks like [[Ricochet (Internet service)|Ricochet]], various high-speed data services over cellular networks, and fixed wireless services.

Research ICT Africa Network.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n== Internet Protocol Suite ==\n{{IP stack}}\nThe Internet standards describe a framework known as the [[Internet protocol suite]] (also called [[TCP/IP]], based on the first two components.) This is a model architecture that divides methods into a [[Communication protocol#Layering|layered system of protocols]], originally documented in {{IETF RFC|1122}} and {{IETF RFC|1123}}.\n\n===Layers===\nThe software layers correspond to the environment or scope in which their services operate. At the top is the [[application layer]], space for the application-specific networking methods used in software applications. For example, a web browser program uses the [[client-server]] application model and a specific protocol of interaction between servers and clients, while many file-sharing systems use a [[peer-to-peer]] paradigm.\n\nBelow this top layer, the [[transport layer]] connects applications on different hosts with a logical channel through the network with appropriate data exchange methods. It provides several services including ordered, reliable delivery (TCP), and an unreliable datagram service (UDP).\n\nUnderlying these layers are the networking technologies that interconnect networks at their borders and exchange traffic across them. The [[Internet layer]] implements the [[Internet Protocol]] which enables computers to identify and locate each other by [[IP address|Internet Protocol (IP) addresses]], and route their traffic via intermediate (transit) networks.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 791, ''Internet Protocol, DARPA Internet Program Protocol Specification'', Information Sciences Institute, Sept. 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The internet protocol layer code is independent of the type of network that it is physically running over.\n\nAt the bottom of the architecture is the [[link layer]], which provides logical connectivity between hosts. The link layer code is usually the only software part customized to the type of physical networking link protocol. Many link layers have been implemented and each operates over a type of network link, such as within a [[local area network]] (LAN) or [[wide area network]] (e.g. [[Wi-Fi]] or [[Ethernet]] or a [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up connection]], [[Asynchronous transfer mode|ATM]] etc.).\n\n[[File:UDP encapsulation.svg|thumb|As user data is processed through the protocol stack, each abstraction layer adds encapsulation information at the sending host. Data is transmitted ''over the wire'' at the link level between hosts and routers. Encapsulation is removed by the receiving host. Intermediate relays update link encapsulation at each hop, and inspect the IP layer for routing purposes.]]\n\n===Internet protocol===\n[[Image:IP stack connections.svg|thumb|Conceptual data flow in a simple network topology of two hosts (''A'' and ''B'') connected by a link between their respective routers. The application on each host executes read and write operations as if the processes were directly connected to each other by some kind of data pipe. After establishment of this pipe, most details of the communication are hidden from each process, as the underlying principles of communication are implemented in the lower protocol layers. In analogy, at the transport layer the communication appears as host-to-host, without knowledge of the application data structures and the connecting routers, while at the internetworking layer, individual network boundaries are traversed at each router.]]\nThe most prominent component of the Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP). IP enables internetworking and, in essence, establishes the Internet itself. Two versions of the Internet Protocol exist, IPV4 and IPV6.\n\n====IP Addresses====\n[[File:An example of theoretical DNS recursion.svg|right|thumb|A DNS resolver consults three name servers to resolve the domain name user-visible &quot;www.wikipedia.org&quot; to determine the IPV4 Address 207.142.131.234]]\nFor locating individual computers on the network, the Internet provides [[IP address]]es. IP addresses are used by the Internet infrastructure to direct internet packets to their destinations. They consist of fixed-length numbers, which are found within the packet. IP addresses are generally assigned to equipment either automatically via [[DHCP]], or are configured.\n\nHowever the network also supports other addressing systems. Users generally enter [[fully qualified domain name|domain name]]s (e.g. &quot;en.wikipedia.org&quot;) instead of IP addresses because they are easier to remember, they are converted by the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) into IP addresses which are more efficient for routing purposes.\n\n====IPv4====\n[[IPv4|Internet Protocol version 4]] (IPv4) defines an IP address as a [[32-bit]] number.&lt;ref name=rfc791&gt;{{Cite IETF|rfc=791|title=Internet Protocol, DARPA Internet Program Protocol Specification|editor=[[Jon Postel|J.

It was designed to address up to \u22484.3 billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) hosts. However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to [[IPv4 address exhaustion]], which entered its final stage in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Huston |first=Geoff |title=IPv4 Address Report, daily generated |url=http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html |accessdate=20 May 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401001902/http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html |archivedate=1 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when the global IPv4 address allocation pool was exhausted.\n\n====IPv6====\nBecause of the growth of the Internet and the [[IPv4 address exhaustion|depletion of available IPv4 addresses]], a new version of IP [[IPv6]], was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic.

In essence, it establishes a parallel version of the Internet not directly accessible with IPv4 software. Thus, translation facilities must exist for internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks. Essentially all modern computer operating systems support both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network infrastructure, however, has been lagging in this development. Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts, e.g., [[peering agreement]]s, and by technical specifications or protocols that describe the exchange of data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies.\n\n====Subnetwork====\n[[File:Subnetting Concept-en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Creating a subnet by dividing the host identifier]]\nA ''[[subnetwork]]'' or ''subnet'' is a logical subdivision of an [[IP network]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rfc950&quot;&gt;{{Cite IETF\n    | rfc         = 950\n    | publisher   = [[IETF]]\n    | author1     = Jeffrey Mogul\n    | author2     = Jon Postel\n    | authorlink2 = Jon Postel\n    | title       = Internet Standard Subnetting Procedure\n    | date        = August 1985\n  }} Updated by RFC 6918.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1,16}} The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called ''subnetting''.\n\nComputers that belong to a subnet are addressed with an identical [[most-significant bit]]-group in their [[IP address]]es. This results in the logical division of an IP address into two fields, the ''network number'' or ''routing prefix'' and the ''rest field'' or ''host identifier''. The ''rest field'' is an identifier for a specific [[Host (network)|host]] or network interface.\n\nThe ''routing prefix'' may be expressed in [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) notation written as the first address of a network, followed by a slash character (''/''), and ending with the bit-length of the prefix. For example, {{IPaddr|198.51.100.0|24}} is the prefix of the [[Internet Protocol version 4]] network starting at the given address, having 24 bits allocated for the network prefix, and the remaining 8 bits reserved for host addressing. Addresses in the range {{IPaddr|198.51.100.0}} to {{IPaddr|198.51.100.255}} belong to this network. The [[IPv6]] address specification {{IPaddr|2001:db8::|32}} is a large address block with 2&lt;sup&gt;96&lt;/sup&gt; addresses, having a 32-bit routing prefix.\n\nFor IPv4, a network may also be characterized by its ''subnet mask'' or ''netmask'', which is the [[bitmask]] that when applied by a [[bitwise AND]] operation to any IP address in the network, yields the routing prefix. Subnet masks are also expressed in [[dot-decimal notation]] like an address. For example, {{IPaddr|255.255.255.0}} is the subnet mask for the prefix {{IPaddr|198.51.100.0|24}}.\n\nTraffic is exchanged between subnetworks through [[router (computing)|routers]] when the routing prefixes of the source address and the destination address differ. A router serves as a logical or physical boundary between the subnets.\n\nThe benefits of subnetting an existing network vary with each deployment scenario. In the address allocation architecture of the Internet using CIDR and in large organizations, it is necessary to allocate address space efficiently. Subnetting may also enhance routing efficiency, or have advantages in network management when subnetworks are administratively controlled by different entities in a larger organization.  Subnets may be arranged logically in a hierarchical architecture, partitioning an organization's network address space into a tree-like routing structure.\n\n===IETF===\nWhile the hardware components in the Internet infrastructure can often be used to support other software systems, it is the design and the standardization process of the software that characterizes the Internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success. The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been assumed by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/ |title=IETF Home Page |publisher=Ietf.org |accessdate=20 June 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618032558/http://www.ietf.org/ |archivedate=18 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture. Resulting contributions and standards are published as ''[[Request for Comments]]'' (RFC) documents on the IETF web site. The principal methods of networking that enable the Internet are contained in specially designated RFCs that constitute the [[Internet Standard]]s. Other less rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet technologies.\n\n== Applications and services ==\nThe Internet carries many [[network service|applications and services]], most prominently the [[World Wide Web]], including [[social media]], [[electronic mail]], [[mobile app]]lications, [[multiplayer online game]]s, [[Internet telephony]], [[file sharing]], and [[streaming media]] services.\n\nMost [[Server (computing)|servers]] that provide these services are today hosted in [[data center]]s, and content is often accessed through high-performance [[content delivery network]]s.\n\n=== World Wide Web ===\n{{Main|World Wide Web}}\n[[File:First Web Server.jpg|thumb|This [[NeXT Computer]] was used by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] at [[CERN]] and became the world's first [[Web server]].]]\n\nThe World Wide Web is a global collection of [[documents]], [[Computer graphics|images]], [[multimedia]], applications, and other resources, logically interrelated by [[hyperlink]]s and referenced with [[Uniform Resource Identifier]]s (URIs), which provide a global system of named references.

[[Web service]]s also use HTTP for communication between software systems for information transfer, sharing and exchanging business data and logistic and is one of many languages or protocols that can be used for communication on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/Web_vs_Internet.asp |title=The Difference Between the Internet and the World Wide Web |work=Webopedia.com |publisher=QuinStreet Inc. |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=2014-05-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502001005/http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/Web_vs_Internet.asp |archivedate=2 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWorld Wide Web browser software, such as [[Microsoft]]'s [[Internet Explorer]]/[[Microsoft Edge|Edge]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], and [[Google Chrome]], lets users navigate from one web page to another via the hyperlinks embedded in the documents. These documents may also contain any combination of [[computer data]], including graphics, sounds, [[Plain text|text]], [[web video|video]], [[multimedia]] and interactive content that runs while the user is interacting with the page. [[Client-side scripting|Client-side software]] can include animations, [[web game|games]], [[office applications]] and scientific demonstrations. Through [[keyword (Internet search)|keyword]]-driven [[Internet research]] using [[Web search engine|search engines]] like [[Yahoo! Search|Yahoo!]], [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] and [[Google Search|Google]], users worldwide have easy, instant access to a vast and diverse amount of online information. Compared to printed media, books, encyclopedias and traditional libraries, the World Wide Web has enabled the decentralization of information on a large scale.\n\nThe Web has enabled individuals and organizations to [[publish]] ideas and information to a potentially large [[audience]] online at greatly reduced expense and time delay. Publishing a web page, a blog, or building a website involves little initial [[cost]] and many cost-free services are available. However, publishing and maintaining large, professional web sites with attractive, diverse and up-to-date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition. Many individuals and some companies and groups use ''web logs'' or blogs, which are largely used as easily updatable online diaries. Some commercial organizations encourage [[employees|staff]] to communicate advice in their areas of specialization in the hope that visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free information, and be attracted to the corporation as a result.\n\n[[Online advertising|Advertising]] on popular web pages can be lucrative, and [[e-commerce]], which is the sale of products and services directly via the Web, continues to grow. Online advertising is a form of [[marketing]] and advertising which uses the Internet to deliver [[promotion (marketing)|promotional]] marketing messages to consumers.  It includes email marketing, [[search engine marketing]] (SEM), social media marketing, many types of [[display advertising]] (including [[web banner]] advertising), and [[mobile advertising]]. In 2011, Internet advertising revenues in the United States surpassed those of [[cable television]] and nearly exceeded those of [[broadcast television]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IAB2012&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.iab.net/media/file/IAB_Internet_Advertising_Revenue_Report_FY_2012_rev.pdf |title = IAB Internet advertising revenue report: 2012 full year results |date = April 2013 |publisher = PricewaterhouseCoopers, Internet Advertising Bureau |accessdate = 12 June 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141004001439/http://www.iab.net/media/file/IAB_Internet_Advertising_Revenue_Report_FY_2012_rev.pdf |archive-date = 4 October 2014 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}} Many common online advertising practices are controversial and increasingly subject to regulation.\n\nWhen the Web developed in the 1990s, a typical web page was stored in completed form on a web server, formatted in [[HTML]], complete for transmission to a web browser in response to a request. Over time, the process of creating and serving web pages has become dynamic, creating a flexible design, layout, and content. Websites are often created using [[content management]] software with, initially, very little content. Contributors to these systems, who may be paid staff, members of an organization or the public, fill underlying databases with content using editing pages designed for that purpose while casual visitors view and read this content in HTML form. There may or may not be editorial, approval and security systems built into the process of taking newly entered content and making it available to the target visitors.\n\n=== Communication ===\n[[Email]] is an important communications service available via the Internet. The concept of sending electronic text messages between parties, analogous to mailing letters or memos, predates the creation of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Brown, Fax invades the mail market, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry64sjvOmLkC&amp;pg=PA218 New Scientist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509050238/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry64sjvOmLkC&amp;pg=PA218 |date=2016-05-09 }}, Vol. 56, No. 817 (Oct., 26, 1972), pp. 218\u201321.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert P. Luckett, What's News: Electronic-mail delivery gets started, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cKSqa8u3EIoC&amp;pg=PA85 Popular Science] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430021738/https://books.google.com/books?id=cKSqa8u3EIoC&amp;pg=PA85 |date=2016-04-30 }}, Vol. 202, No. 3 (March 1973); page 85&lt;/ref&gt; Pictures, documents, and other files are sent as [[email attachment]]s. Email messages can be [[Carbon copy|cc-ed]] to multiple [[email address]]es.\n\n[[Internet telephony]] is a common communications service realized with the Internet. The name of the principle internetworking protocol, the [[Internet Protocol]], lends its name to [[voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP). The idea began in the early 1990s with [[walkie-talkie]]-like voice applications for personal computers. VoIP systems now dominate many markets, and are as easy to use and as convenient as a traditional telephone. The benefit has been in substantial cost savings over traditional telephone calls, especially over long distances. [[Cable modem|Cable]], [[ADSL]], and [[mobile data]] networks provide [[Internet access]] in customer premises&lt;ref name=EBSCOhost&gt;{{cite journal|last=Booth|first=C|title=Chapter 2: IP Phones, Software VoIP, and Integrated and Mobile VoIP|journal=Library Technology Reports|year=2010|volume=46|issue=5|pages=11\u201319}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inexpensive VoIP network adapters provide the connection for traditional analog telephone sets. The voice quality of VoIP often exceeds that of traditional calls. Remaining problems for VoIP include the situation that emergency services may not be universally available, and that devices rely on a local power supply, while older traditional phones are powered from the local loop, and typically operate during a power failure.\n\n=== Data transfer ===\n[[File sharing]] is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the Internet. A [[computer file]] can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment. It can be uploaded to a website or [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) server for easy download by others. It can be put into a &quot;shared location&quot; or onto a [[file server]] for instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of &quot;[[Web mirror|mirror]]&quot; servers or [[peer-to-peer]] networks. In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user [[authentication]], the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by [[encryption]], and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed\u2014usually fully encrypted\u2014across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by [[digital signature]]s or by [[MD5]] or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.\n\n[[Streaming media]] is the real-time delivery of digital media for the immediate consumption or enjoyment by end users. Many radio and television broadcasters provide Internet feeds of their live audio and video productions. They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet &quot;broadcasters&quot; who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to access on-line media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical [[webcast]]s to on-demand popular multimedia services. [[Podcast]]ing is a variation on this theme, where\u2014usually audio\u2014material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a [[portable media player]] to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide.\n\nDigital media streaming increases the demand for network bandwidth.  For example, standard image quality needs 1 Mbit/s link speed for SD 480p, HD 720p quality requires 2.5 Mbit/s, and the top-of-the-line HDX quality needs 4.5 Mbit/s for 1080p.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Morrison |first=Geoff |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40241749 |title=What to know before buying a 'connected' TV \u2013 Technology &amp; science \u2013 Tech and gadgets \u2013 Tech Holiday Guide |publisher=NBC News |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200212091603/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40241749 |archive-date=12 February 2020 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Webcam]]s are a low-cost extension of this phenomenon. While some webcams can give full-frame-rate video, the picture either is usually small or updates slowly. Internet users can watch animals around an African waterhole, ships in the [[Panama Canal]], traffic at a local roundabout or monitor their own premises, live and in real time. Video [[chat rooms]] and [[video conferencing]] are also popular with many uses being found for personal webcams, with and without two-way sound. YouTube was founded on 15 February 2005 and is now the leading website for free streaming video with more than two billion users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Press - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/about/press/|access-date=2020-08-19|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses an HTML5 based web player by default to stream and show video files.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://youtube-eng.googleblog.com/2015/01/youtube-now-defaults-to-html5_27.html|title=YouTube now defaults to HTML5 &lt;video&gt;|work=YouTube Engineering and Developers Blog|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910204225/https://youtube-eng.googleblog.com/2015/01/youtube-now-defaults-to-html5_27.html|archive-date=10 September 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Registered users may upload an unlimited amount of video and build their own personal profile. [[YouTube]] claims that its users watch hundreds of millions, and upload hundreds of thousands of videos daily.\n\n== Social impact ==\nThe Internet has enabled new forms of social interaction, activities, and social associations. This phenomenon has given rise to the scholarly study of the [[sociology of the Internet]].\n\n=== Users ===\n{{See also|Global Internet usage|English in computing|Languages used on the Internet}}\n{{Image frame\n|width=520&lt;!-- Must be kept at this size at this point (December 2017) --&gt;\n|content ={{Global Heat Maps by Year| title=| table=Share of population using the Internet.tab| column=percent| columnName=percent using the Internet| year=2016}}\n|caption=Share of population using the Internet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ritchie |first1=Hannah |last2=Roser |first2=Max |title=Technology Adoption |url=https://ourworldindata.org/technology-adoption |journal=Our World in Data |accessdate=12 October 2019 |date=2 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012121855/https://ourworldindata.org/technology-adoption |archive-date=12 October 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n|align=right\n}}\n[[File:Internet users per 100 inhabitants ITU.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;'''Internet users per 100 inhabitants'''&lt;/div&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source: [[International Telecommunications Union]].&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/statistics/2014/ITU_Key_2005-2014_ICT_data.xls &quot;Individuals using the Internet 2005 to 2014&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528031339/http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/statistics/2014/ITU_Key_2005-2014_ICT_data.xls |date=28 May 2015 }}, Key ICT indicators for developed and developing countries and the world (totals and penetration rates), International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

The Internet can be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, including through [[mobile Internet device]]s. Mobile phones, [[datacard]]s, [[handheld game console]]s and [[cellular router]]s allow users to connect to the Internet [[wireless]]ly. Within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices, the services of the Internet, including email and the web, may be available. Service providers may restrict the services offered and mobile data charges may be significantly higher than other access methods.\n\nEducational material at all levels from pre-school to post-doctoral is available from websites. Examples range from [[CBeebies]], through school and high-school revision guides and [[Virtual university|virtual universities]], to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of [[Google Scholar]]. For [[distance education]], help with [[homework]] and other assignments, self-guided learning, whiling away spare time, or just looking up more detail on an interesting fact, it has never been easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere. The Internet in general and the [[World Wide Web]] in particular are important enablers of both [[Education|formal]] and [[informal education]]. Further, the Internet allows universities, in particular, researchers from the social and behavioral sciences, to conduct research remotely via virtual laboratories, with profound changes in reach and generalizability of findings as well as in communication between scientists and in the publication of results.&lt;ref&gt;Reips, U.-D.

Retrieved 22 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills have made [[collaboration|collaborative]] work dramatically easier, with the help of [[collaborative software]]. Not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups more easily to form. An example of this is the [[free software movement]], which has produced, among other things, [[Linux]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], and [[OpenOffice.org]] (later forked into [[LibreOffice]]). Internet chat, whether using an [[IRC]] chat room, an [[instant messaging]] system, or a [[social networking]] website, allows colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way while working at their computers during the day.  Messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via email. These systems may allow files to be exchanged, drawings and images to be shared, or voice and video contact between team members.\n\n[[Content management]] systems allow collaborating teams to work on shared sets of documents simultaneously without accidentally destroying each other's work. Business and project teams can share calendars as well as documents and other information. Such collaboration occurs in a wide variety of areas including scientific research, software development, conference planning, political activism and creative writing. Social and political collaboration is also becoming more widespread as both Internet access and [[computer literacy]] spread.\n\nThe Internet allows computer users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point. Access may be with [[computer security]], i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, depending on the requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can [[audit]] the books of a company based in another country, on a [[server (computing)|server]] situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before the widespread use of the Internet, but the cost of private [[leased line]]s would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps on the other side of the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using [[cloud computing]], or open a [[Remote Desktop Protocol|remote desktop]] session into their office PC using a secure [[virtual private network]] (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among [[system administrator]]s as the Virtual Private Nightmare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Virtual Private Nightmare: VPN |url=http://librenix.com/?inode=5013 |publisher=Librenix |accessdate=21 July 2010 |date=4 August 2004 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515152637/http://librenix.com/?inode=5013 |archivedate=15 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes.\n\n=== Social networking and entertainment ===\n{{See also|Social networking service#Social impact}}\nMany people use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book vacations and to pursue their personal interests. People use [[online chat|chat]], messaging and email to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had [[pen pal]]s. [[Social network service|Social networking]] websites such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Myspace]] have created new ways to socialize and interact. Users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of information to pages, to pursue common interests, and to connect with others. It is also possible to find existing acquaintances, to allow communication among existing groups of people. Sites like [[LinkedIn]] foster commercial and business connections. YouTube and [[Flickr]] specialize in users' videos and photographs. While social networking sites were initially for individuals only, today they are widely used by businesses and other organizations to promote their brands, to market to their customers and to encourage posts to &quot;[[Viral marketing|go viral]]&quot;. &quot;Black hat&quot; social media techniques are also employed by some organizations, such as [[Spamming|spam]] accounts and [[astroturfing]].\n\nA risk for both individuals and organizations writing posts (especially public posts) on social networking websites, is that especially foolish or controversial posts occasionally lead to an unexpected and possibly large-scale backlash on social media from other Internet users. This is also a risk in relation to controversial ''offline'' behavior, if it is widely made known. The nature of this backlash can range widely from counter-arguments and public mockery, through insults and [[hate speech]], to, in extreme cases, rape and death [[Computer crime#Threats|threats]]. The [[online disinhibition effect]] describes the tendency of many individuals to behave more stridently or offensively online than they would in person. A significant number of [[feminist]] women have been the target of various forms of [[harassment]] in response to posts they have made on social media, and Twitter in particular has been criticised in the past for not doing enough to aid victims of online abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23477130 |title=Twitter 'report abuse' button calls after rape threats |last=Moore |first=Keith |date=27 July 2013 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=7 December 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904014545/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23477130 |archivedate=4 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nFor organizations, such a backlash can cause overall [[public relations|brand damage]], especially if reported by the media. However, this is not always the case, as any brand damage in the eyes of people with an opposing opinion to that presented by the organization could sometimes be outweighed by strengthening the brand in the eyes of others. Furthermore, if an organization or individual gives in to demands that others perceive as wrong-headed, that can then provoke a counter-backlash.\n\nSome websites, such as [[Reddit]], have rules forbidding the posting of [[personal information]] of individuals (also known as [[doxxing]]), due to concerns about such postings leading to mobs of large numbers of Internet users directing harassment at the specific individuals thereby identified. In particular, the Reddit rule forbidding the posting of personal information is widely understood to imply that all identifying photos and names must be [[censored]] in Facebook [[screenshots]] posted to Reddit. However, the interpretation of this rule in relation to public Twitter posts is less clear, and in any case, like-minded people online have many other ways they can use to direct each other's attention to public social media posts they disagree with.\n\nChildren also face dangers online such as [[cyberbullying]] and [[Child grooming|approaches by sexual predators]], who sometimes pose as children themselves. Children may also encounter material which they may find upsetting, or material which their parents consider to be not age-appropriate. Due to naivety, they may also post personal information about themselves online, which could put them or their families at risk unless warned not to do so. Many parents choose to enable [[Content-control software|Internet filtering]], and/or supervise their children's online activities, in an attempt to protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet. The most popular social networking websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, commonly forbid users under the age of 13. However, these policies are typically trivial to circumvent by registering an account with a false birth date, and a significant number of children aged under 13 join such sites anyway. Social networking sites for younger children, which claim to provide better levels of protection for children, also exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2010/10/11/social-networks-children/ |title=5 Fun and Safe Social Networks for Children |date=11 October 2010 |accessdate=7 December 2014 |website=[[Mashable]] |last=Kessler |first=Sarah |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220082237/http://mashable.com/2010/10/11/social-networks-children/ |archivedate=20 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Internet has been a major outlet for leisure activity since its inception, with entertaining [[social experiment]]s such as [[MUD]]s and [[MOO]]s being conducted on university servers, and humor-related [[Usenet]] groups receiving much traffic.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Many [[Internet forums]] have sections devoted to games and funny videos.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The [[Internet pornography]] and [[online gambling]] industries have taken advantage of the World Wide Web.

Whereas, before the Internet, expectations of success in any field were supported by reasonable probabilities of achievement at the village, suburb, city or even state level, the same expectations in the Internet world are virtually certain to bring disappointment today:  there is always someone else, somewhere on the planet, who can do better and take the now one-and-only top spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barker|first=Eric|title=Barking Up the Wrong Tree|publisher=HarperCollins|date=2017|isbn=9780062416049|pages=235\u20136}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Cybersectarianism]] is a new organizational form which involves: &quot;highly dispersed small groups of practitioners that may remain largely anonymous within the larger social context and operate in relative secrecy, while still linked remotely to a larger network of believers who share a set of practices and texts, and often a common devotion to a particular leader.  Overseas supporters provide funding and support; domestic practitioners distribute tracts, participate in acts of resistance, and share information on the internal situation with outsiders.  Collectively, members and practitioners of such sects construct viable virtual communities of faith, exchanging personal testimonies and engaging in the collective study via email, on-line chat rooms, and web-based message boards.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M.

Kiva raises funds for local intermediary [[microfinance]] organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay. Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php ''Kiva Is Not Quite What It Seems''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210045011/http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php |date=10 February 2010 }}, by David Roodman, Center for Global Development, 2 October 2009, as accessed 2 &amp; 16 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Strom |first=Stephanie |title=Confusion on Where Money Lent via Kiva Goes |work=The New York Times |page=6 |date=9 November 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129225155/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html |archivedate=29 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n== Security ==\n{{Main|Internet security}}\nInternet resources, hardware, and software components are the target of criminal or malicious attempts to gain unauthorized control to cause interruptions, commit fraud, engage in blackmail or access private information.\n\n===Malware===\n[[Malware]] is malicious software used and distributed via the Internet.

Computers communicate over the Internet by breaking up messages (emails, images, videos, web pages, files, etc.) into small chunks called &quot;packets&quot;, which are routed through a network of computers, until they reach their destination, where they are assembled back into a complete &quot;message&quot; again. [[Packet Capture Appliance]] intercepts these packets as they are traveling through the network, in order to examine their contents using other programs. A packet capture is an information ''gathering'' tool, but not an ''analysis'' tool. That is it gathers &quot;messages&quot; but it does not analyze them and figure out what they mean. Other programs are needed to perform [[traffic analysis]] and sift through intercepted data looking for important/useful information.

Questions concerning the [[philosophy of language]], such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated at least since [[Gorgias]] and [[Plato]] in [[ancient Greece]]. Thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] have argued that language originated from emotions while others like [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. Twentieth century philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Noam Chomsky]].\n\nEstimates of the number of human languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on the arbitrary distinction (dichotomy) between languages and [[dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kamusella |first1=Tomasz |author-link=Tomasz Kamusella |date=2016 |title=The History of the Normative Opposition of 'Language versus Dialect': From Its Graeco-Latin Origin to Central Europe's Ethnolinguistic Nation-States |url=http://ispan.waw.pl/journals/index.php/ch/article/download/ch.2016.011/2342 |journal=Colloquia Humanistica |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=189\u2013198 |doi=10.11649/ch.2016.011 |access-date=9 February 2020 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural language]]s are [[speech|spoken]] or [[sign language|signed]], but any language can be [[Encoding (semiotics)|encoded]] into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]&amp;nbsp;\u2013 for example, in writing, whistling, signing, or [[braille]]. This is because human language is [[Modality (semiotics)|modality]]-independent. Depending on [[philosophy of language|philosophical perspectives]] regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, &quot;language&quot; may refer to the cognitive ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. All languages rely on the process of [[semiosis]] to relate [[Sign (linguistics)|signs]] to particular [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]]. [[Oral language|Oral]], [[sign language|manual]] and tactile languages contain a [[phonology|phonological]] system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or [[morpheme]]s, and a [[syntax|syntactic]] system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances.\n\nHuman language has the properties of [[Productivity (linguistics)|productivity]] and [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of [[animal communication]]. Language is thought to have originated when early [[hominin]]s started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a [[Theory of mind|theory of other minds]] and a shared [[intentionality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Tomasello|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hauser 2002&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hauser|Chomsky|Fitch|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the [[human brain]], but especially in [[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area]]s. Humans [[language acquisition|acquire]] language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently by approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human [[culture]]. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group [[Identity (social science)|identity]], [[social stratification]], as well as [[social grooming]] and [[entertainment]].\n\nLanguages [[language change|evolve]] and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be [[historical linguistics|reconstructed]] by [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparing]] modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a [[language family]]. A language that has been demonstrated to not have any living or non-living [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|relationship]] with another language is called a [[language isolate]]. Languages whose relationships have not been established are [[unclassified language|unclassified]]. Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become [[Language death|extinct]] by the year 2100.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moseley&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graddol|first=D.|date=2004-02-27|title=The Future of Language|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1096546|journal=Science|volume=303|issue=5662|pages=1329\u20131331|doi=10.1126/science.1096546|issn=0036-8075}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n== Definitions ==\n{{main|Philosophy of language}}\nThe English word ''language'' derives ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] {{lang|PIE|*dn\u0325\u01f5\u02b0w\u00e9h\u2082s}} &quot;tongue, speech, language&quot; through [[Latin]] {{lang|la|[[wikt:lingua#Latin|lingua]]}}, &quot;language; tongue&quot;, and [[Old French]] {{lang|fro|[[wikt:language#Old French|language]]}}.&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=language |encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=3rd|year=1992|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is sometimes used to refer to [[code]]s, [[cipher]]s, and other kinds of [[constructed language|artificially constructed communication systems]] such as formally defined computer languages used for [[programming language|computer programming]]. Unlike conventional human languages, a [[formal language]] in this sense is a [[system]] of [[Sign (linguistics)|signs]] for [[encoding]] and decoding [[information]]. This article specifically concerns the properties of [[Natural language|natural human language]] as it is studied in the discipline of [[linguistics]].\n\nAs an object of linguistic study, &quot;language&quot; has two primary meanings: an abstract concept, and a specific linguistic system, e.g. &quot;[[French language|French]]&quot;. The Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who defined the modern discipline of linguistics, first explicitly formulated the distinction using the French word {{lang|fr|langage}} for language as a concept, {{lang|fr|[[langue and parole|langue]]}} as a specific instance of a language system, and {{lang|fr|parole}} for the concrete usage of speech in a particular language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons2&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWhen speaking of language as a general concept, definitions can be used which stress different aspects of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=&quot;LyonsIntro&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=1\u20138}}&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions also entail different approaches and understandings of language, and they also inform different and often incompatible schools of [[Theory of language | linguistic theory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TraskLanguage&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pages=129\u201331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates about the nature and origin of language go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as [[Gorgias]] and [[Plato]] debated the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication and truth were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and prior to, language.{{sfn|Bett|2010}}\n\nDuring the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and its debates about human origins, it became fashionable to speculate about the origin of language. Thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world&amp;nbsp;\u2013 asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn impose on our experience of the objective world. This led to the question of whether philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the [[linguistic turn]] and philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.{{sfn|Devitt|Sterelny|1999}}\n\n===Mental faculty, organ or instinct===\nOne definition sees language primarily as the [[mind|mental faculty]] that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and to produce and understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the [[human brain]]. Proponents of the view that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, [[creole languages]] and spontaneously developed sign languages such as [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]]. This view, which can be traced back to the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely [[innatism|innate]], for example, in [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky's]] theory of [[Universal Grammar]], or American philosopher [[Jerry Fodor]]'s extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a [[cognitive science]] framework and in [[neurolinguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hauser|Fitch|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Language Instinct&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Pinker|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Formal symbolic system===\nAnother definition sees language as a [[formal system]] of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages can be described as closed [[structural linguistics|structural systems]] consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings.{{sfn|Trask|2007|p=93}} This [[structuralism|structuralist]] view of language was first introduced by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Saussure&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Saussure|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2001|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSome proponents of Saussure's view of language have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements and then by presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is [[Noam Chomsky]], the originator of the [[generative linguistics|generative theory of grammar]], who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars.{{sfn|Trask|2007|p=130}} Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature of the human mind and to constitute the rudiments of what language is.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Chomsky|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used in [[formal logic]], in [[formal linguistics]], and in applied [[computational linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=93, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NewmeyerForm&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Newmeyer|1998|pp=3\u20136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and other [[formal logic]]ians.\n\n===Tool for communication===\n[[File:ASL family.jpg|right|thumb|A conversation in [[American Sign Language]]]]\nYet another definition sees language as a system of communication that enables humans to exchange verbal or symbolic utterances. This definition stresses the social functions of language and the fact that humans use it to express themselves and to manipulate objects in their environment. [[Functional theories of grammar]] explain grammatical structures by their communicative functions, and understand the grammatical structures of language to be the result of an adaptive process by which grammar was &quot;tailored&quot; to serve the communicative needs of its users.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myths&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Van Valin|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThis view of language is associated with the study of language in [[pragmatics|pragmatic]], [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive]], and interactive frameworks, as well as in [[sociolinguistics]] and [[linguistic anthropology]]. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of [[linguistic typology]], or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of [[grammaticalization]] tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewmeyerForm&quot;/&gt; In the philosophy of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein's]] later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as [[J.L. Austin]], [[Paul Grice]], [[John Searle]], and [[Willard van Orman Quine|W.O. Quine]].{{sfn|Nerlich|2010|p=192}}\n\n===Distinctive features of human language===\n{{main|Animal language|Great ape language}}\n\nA number of features, many of which were described by [[Charles Hockett]] and called [[Hockett's design features|design features]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html |title=The Problem of Universals in Language |last=Hockett |first=Charles F. |date=1966 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110023354/http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html |archive-date=10 November 2012 |url-status=dead |access-date=11 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; set human language apart from communication used by non-human [[Animal language|animals]].\n\nCommunication systems used by other animals such as [[Bee learning and communication|bees]] or [[great ape language|apes]] are closed systems that consist of a finite, usually very limited, number of possible ideas that can be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hockett|1960}}; {{harvcoltxt|Deacon|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, human language is open-ended and [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]], meaning that it allows humans to produce a vast range of utterances from a finite set of elements, and to create new words and sentences. This is possible because human language is based on a dual code, in which a finite number of elements which are meaningless in themselves (e.g. sounds, letters or gestures) can be combined to form an infinite number of larger units of meaning (words and sentences).&lt;ref name=&quot;Trask5&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pages=1\u20135}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one study has demonstrated that an Australian bird, the [[chestnut-crowned babbler]], is capable of using the same acoustic elements in different arrangements to create two functionally distinct vocalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Engesser |first1=Sabrina|last2=Crane |first2=Jodie S.|last3=Savage |first3=James L.|last4=Russel |first4=Andrew F. |last5=Townsend |first5=Simon W. |date=29 June 2015 |title=Experimental Evidence for Phonemic Contrasts in a Nonhuman Vocal System |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=13|issue=6|pages=e1002171|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002171|pmid=26121619 |pmc=4488142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Southern pied babbler|pied babblers]] have demonstrated the ability to generate two functionally distinct vocalisations composed of the same sound type, which can only be distinguished by the number of repeated elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Engesser |first1=Sabrina|last2=Ridley |first2=Amanda R.|last3=Townsend |first3=Simon W. |s2cid=21470061|date=20 July 2017 |title=Element repetition rates encode functionally distinct information in pied babbler 'clucks' and 'purrs' |journal=Animal Cognition |volume=20 |issue=5|pages=953\u201360|doi=10.1007/s10071-017-1114-6|pmid=28730513|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/89798/7/WRAP-element-repetition-rates-encode-functionally-Townsend-2017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSeveral species of animals have proved to be able to acquire forms of communication through social learning: for instance a [[bonobo]] named [[Kanzi]] learned to express itself using a set of symbolic [[lexigram]]s. Similarly, many species of birds and whales learn their songs by imitating other members of their species. However, while some animals may acquire large numbers of words and symbols,{{refn|group=note|The gorilla [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]] reportedly used as many as 1000 words in [[American Sign Language]], and understands 2000 words of spoken English. There are some doubts about whether her use of signs is based on complex understanding or simple [[Operant conditioning|conditioning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Candland|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} none have been able to learn as many different signs as are generally known by an average 4 year old human, nor have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deacon 1997&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Deacon|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHuman languages differ from animal communication systems in that they employ [[grammatical categories|grammatical and semantic categories]], such as noun and verb, present and past, which may be used to express exceedingly complex meanings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deacon 1997&quot;/&gt; It is distinguished by the property of [[Recursion#Recursion in language|recursivity]]: for example, a noun phrase can contain another noun phrase (as in &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[the chimpanzee]'s lips]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;) or a clause can contain another clause (as in &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[I see [the dog is running]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hauser 2002&quot;/&gt; Human language is the only known natural communication system whose adaptability may be referred to as ''modality independent''. This means that it can be used not only for communication through one channel or medium, but through several. For example, spoken language uses the auditive modality, whereas [[sign language]]s and writing use the visual modality, and [[braille]] writing uses the tactile modality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=165\u201366}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHuman language is unusual in being able to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events that took place in the past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called ''[[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]]'', and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of [[bee]]s that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human language is also considered unique.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trask5&quot;/&gt;\n\n==Origin==\n{{Main|Origin of language|Origin of speech}}\n{{See also|Proto-Human language}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n| image1    = Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Tower of Babel (Vienna) - Google Art Project - edited.jpg\n| alt1\n| caption1  = ''[[The Tower of Babel (Bruegel)|The Tower of Babel]]'' by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]].

Some theories are based on the idea that language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on the generative view of language pioneered by [[Noam Chomsky]] see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ulbaek 1998&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ulbaek|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nChomsky is one prominent proponent of a discontinuity-based theory of human language origins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ulbaek 1998&quot;/&gt; He suggests that for scholars interested in the nature of language, &quot;talk about the evolution of the language capacity is beside the point.&quot;{{sfn|Chomsky|1972|p=86}} Chomsky proposes that perhaps &quot;some random mutation took place [...] and it reorganized the brain, implanting a language organ in an otherwise primate brain.&quot;{{sfn|Chomsky|2000|p=4}} Though cautioning against taking this story literally, Chomsky insists that &quot;it may be closer to reality than many other fairy tales that are told about evolutionary processes, including language.&quot;{{sfn|Chomsky|2000|p=4}}\n\nContinuity-based theories are held by a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Those who see language as being mostly innate, for example psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], hold the precedents to be [[animal cognition]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Language Instinct&quot;/&gt; whereas those who see language as a socially learned tool of communication, such as psychologist [[Michael Tomasello]], see it as having developed from [[animal communication]] in primates: either gestural or vocal communication to assist in cooperation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tomasello 2008&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Tomasello|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other continuity-based models see language as having developed from [[music]], a view already espoused by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]], and [[Charles Darwin]]. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist [[Steven Mithen]].{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=466\u2013507}} [[Stephen R. Anderson|Stephen Anderson]] states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000 years&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Anderson|2012|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only once, and that all modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can no longer be recovered&amp;nbsp;... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Anderson|2012|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\nBecause language emerged in the early [[prehistory]] of man, before the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and it is believed that no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. Early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a [[larynx]] capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=250\u201392}}\n\nIt was mostly undisputed that pre-human [[australopithecine]]s did not have communication systems significantly different from those found in [[great ape]]s in general. However, a 2017 study on [[Origin of language#Ardipithecus ramidus|Ardipithecus ramidus]] challenges this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2017.03.001 |pmid=28363458 |title=Ardipithecus ramidus and the evolution of language and singing: An early origin for hominin vocal capability |journal=HOMO |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=101\u201321 |year=2017 |last1=Clark |first1=Gary |last2=Henneberg |first2=Maciej }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of the genus ''[[Homo]]'' some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (proto-language) as early as ''[[Homo habilis]]'' (2.3 million years ago) while others place the development of primitive symbolic communication only with ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (1.8 million years ago) or ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' (0.6 million years ago), and the development of language proper with [[Anatomically modern humans|Anatomically Modern ''Homo sapiens'']] with the [[behavioral modernity|Upper Paleolithic revolution]] less than 100,000 years ago.{{sfn|Foley|1997|pp=70\u201374}}{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=292\u201393}}\n\n==Study==\n[[File:Sir William Jones.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] discovered the family relation between [[Latin]] and [[Sanskrit]], laying the ground for the discipline of [[historical linguistics]].]]\n[[File:Ferdinand de Saussure by Jullien.png|thumb|upright|[[Ferdinand de Saussure]] developed the [[structuralism|structuralist]] approach to studying language.]]\n[[File:Noam chomsky cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Noam Chomsky]] is one of the most important linguistic theorists of the 20th century.]]\n{{main|Linguistics|History of linguistics}}\nThe study of language, [[linguistics]], has been developing into a science since the first grammatical descriptions of particular languages in [[India]] more than 2000 years ago, after the development of the [[Brahmi script]]. Modern linguistics is a science that concerns itself with all aspects of language, examining it from all of the theoretical viewpoints described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Newmeyer|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Subdisciplines===\nThe academic study of language is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles, all of which inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, [[descriptive linguistics]] examines the grammar of single languages, [[theoretical linguistics]] develops theories on how best to conceptualize and define the nature of language based on data from the various extant human languages, [[sociolinguistics]] studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions of language and grammatical description, [[neurolinguistics]] studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, [[computational linguistics]] builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses, and [[historical linguistics]] relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language families by using the [[comparative method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Early history===\nThe formal study of language is often considered to have started in [[India]] with [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]], the 5th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of [[Sanskrit]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. However, [[Sumer]]ian scribes already studied the differences between [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] grammar around 1900 BC. Subsequent grammatical traditions developed in all of the ancient cultures that adopted writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2001|pp=82\u201383}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the 17th century AD, the French [[Port-Royal Grammar]]ians developed the idea that the grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics of thought, and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of the [[comparative method]] by British [[philologist]] and expert on ancient India [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] sparked the rise of [[comparative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1914|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific study of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. Early in the 20th century, [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saussure&quot;/&gt;\n\nBy introducing a distinction between [[Diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] and [[Synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] analyses of language, he laid the foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagm]] and [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigm]], and the [[Langue and parole|Langue-parole distinction]], distinguishing language as an abstract system (''langue''), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (''parole'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Clarke|1990|pages=143\u201344}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== Modern linguistics ===\nIn the 1960s, [[Noam Chomsky]] formulated the [[Generative linguistics|generative theory of language]]. According to this theory, the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called [[Universal Grammar]]; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997|pp=82\u201383}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn opposition to the formal theories of the generative school, [[Functional theories of grammar|functional theories of language]] propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. [[Formal grammar|Formal theories of grammar]] seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewmeyerForm&quot;/&gt;{{refn|group=note|&quot;Functional grammar analyzes grammatical structure, as do formal and structural grammar; but it also analyzes the entire communicative situation: the purpose of the speech event, its participants, its discourse context. Functionalists maintain that the communicative situation motivates, constrains, explains, or otherwise determines grammatical structure, and that a structural or formal approach is not merely limited to an artificially restricted data base, but is inadequate even as a structural account. Functional grammar, then, differs from formal and structural grammar in that it purports not to model but to explain; and the explanation is grounded in the communicative situation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Nichols|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The framework of [[cognitive linguistics]] interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|Cruse|2004|pp=1\u20134}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Physiological and neural architecture of language and speech==\nSpeaking is the default modality for language in all cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus, the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring and producing language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pp=11\u201314, 105\u201313}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the [[genetics|genetic]] bases for human language is at an early stage: the only gene that has definitely been implicated in language production is [[FOXP2]], which may cause a kind of [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia|congenital language disorder]] if affected by [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Fisher|Lai|Monaco|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===The brain===\n{{main|Neurolinguistics|Language processing in the brain}}\n[[File:Brain Surface Gyri.SVG|thumb|Language Areas of the brain. The [[Angular Gyrus]] is represented in orange, [[Supramarginal Gyrus]] is represented in yellow, [[Broca's area]] is represented in blue, [[Wernicke's area]] is represented in green, and the [[Primary Auditory Cortex]] is represented in pink.]] The brain is the coordinating center of all linguistic activity; it controls both the production of linguistic cognition and of meaning and the mechanics of speech production. Nonetheless, our knowledge of the neurological bases for language is quite limited, though it has advanced considerably with the use of modern imaging techniques. The discipline of linguistics dedicated to studying the neurological aspects of language is called [[neurolinguistics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lesser205&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lesser|1989|pp=205\u201306}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nEarly work in neurolinguistics involved the study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is [[Wernicke's area]], which is in the posterior section of the [[superior temporal gyrus]] in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop [[receptive aphasia]], a condition in which there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal [[syntax|sentence structure]]. The second area is [[Broca's area]], in the posterior [[inferior frontal gyrus]] of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop [[expressive aphasia]], meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pp=105\u201307}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with [[word repetition]]. The condition affects both spoken and written language. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Sandler|Lillo-Martin|2001|p=554}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWith technological advances in the late 20th century, neurolinguists have also incorporated non-invasive techniques such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[electrophysiology]] to study language processing in individuals without impairments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lesser205&quot;/&gt;\n\n===Anatomy of speech===\n{{main|Speech production|Phonetics|Articulatory phonetics}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = Illu01 head neck.jpg\n| caption1  = The human vocal tract.\n| image2    = Spectrogram -iua-.png\n| caption2  = [[Spectrogram]] of American English vowels {{IPA|[i, u, \u0251]}} showing the formants ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;\n|image3     = Real-time MRI - Speaking (Chinese).ogv\n|caption3   = Real time MRI scan of a person speaking in Mandarin Chinese\n}}\nSpoken language relies on human physical ability to produce [[sound]], which is a longitudinal wave propagated through the air at a frequency capable of vibrating the [[ear drum]]. This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box ([[larynx]]), and the upper vocal tract&amp;nbsp;\u2013 the throat, the mouth, and the nose. By controlling the different parts of the speech apparatus, the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe sound of speech can be analyzed into a combination of [[Segment (linguistics)|segmental and suprasegmental]] elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between them. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which are a result of their different articulations, and can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[phonation]] type, voice [[timbre]], and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] or [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], all of which may have effects across multiple segments.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacMahon5&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Consonant]]s and [[vowel]] segments combine to form [[syllable]]s, which in turn combine to form utterances; these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations. [[Acoustics|Acoustically]], these different segments are characterized by different [[formant]] structures, that are visible in a [[spectrogram]] of the recorded sound wave. Formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacMahon5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IPA&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|pp=3\u20138}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nVowels are those sounds that have no audible friction caused by the narrowing or obstruction of some part of the upper vocal tract. They vary in quality according to the degree of lip aperture and the placement of the tongue within the oral cavity.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacMahon5&quot;/&gt; Vowels are called ''[[Close vowel|close]]'' when the lips are relatively closed, as in the pronunciation of the vowel {{ipa|[i]}} (English &quot;ee&quot;), or ''[[open vowel|open]]'' when the lips are relatively open, as in the vowel {{ipa|[a]}} (English &quot;ah&quot;). If the tongue is located towards the back of the mouth, the quality changes, creating vowels such as {{ipa|[u]}} (English &quot;oo&quot;). The quality also changes depending on whether the lips are [[Roundedness|rounded]] as opposed to unrounded, creating distinctions such as that between {{ipa|[i]}} (unrounded front vowel such as English &quot;ee&quot;) and {{ipa|[y]}} ([[rounded front vowel]] such as German &quot;\u00fc&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=11\u201315}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nConsonants are those sounds that have audible friction or closure at some point within the upper vocal tract. Consonant sounds vary by place of articulation, i.e. the place in the vocal tract where the airflow is obstructed, commonly at the lips, teeth, [[alveolar ridge]], [[palate]], [[Soft palate|velum]], [[uvula]], or [[glottis]]. Each place of articulation produces a different set of consonant sounds, which are further distinguished by [[manner of articulation]], or the kind of friction, whether full closure, in which case the consonant is called ''[[occlusive]]'' or ''[[stop consonant|stop]]'', or different degrees of aperture creating ''[[fricative]]s'' and ''[[approximant consonant|approximants]]''. Consonants can also be either ''[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced or unvoiced]]'', depending on whether the vocal cords are set in vibration by airflow during the production of the sound. Voicing is what separates English {{ipa|[s]}} in ''bus'' ([[sibilant|unvoiced sibilant]]) from {{ipa|[z]}} in ''buzz'' ([[Voiced alveolar sibilant#Voiced alveolar sibilant|voiced sibilant]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=6\u201311}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSome speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve release of air flow through the nasal cavity, and these are called ''[[Nasal consonant|nasals]]'' or ''[[Nasalization|nasalized]]'' sounds. Other sounds are defined by the way the tongue moves within the mouth such as the l-sounds (called ''[[Lateral consonant|laterals]]'', because the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds (called ''[[rhotics]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;IPA&quot;/&gt;\n\nBy using these speech organs, humans can produce hundreds of distinct sounds: some appear very often in the world's languages, whereas others are much more common in certain language families, language areas, or even specific to a single language.&lt;ref name=&quot;LadefogedMaddieson&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Structure==\nWhen described as a system of [[symbolic communication]], language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], [[meaning (semiotics)|meanings]], and a [[code (semiotics)|code]] connecting signs with their meanings. The study of the process of [[semiosis]], how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called [[semiotics]]. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons17&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=17\u201324}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Ancient Tamil Script.jpg|thumb|right|Ancient [[Tamil language|Tamil]] inscription at [[Thanjavur]]]]\nSome of the properties that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign, meaning that there is no predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, meaning that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases; the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the linguistic system, meaning that the finite number of linguistic elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons17&quot;/&gt;\n\nThe rules by which signs can be combined to form words and phrases are called [[syntax]] or grammar. The meaning that is connected to individual signs, morphemes, words, phrases, and texts is called [[semantics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division of language into separate but connected systems of sign and meaning goes back to the first linguistic studies of de Saussure and is now used in almost all branches of linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=218\u201324}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Semantics===\n{{main|Semantics|Semiotics|Meaning (linguistics)}}\nLanguages express meaning by relating a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must be something that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, in the sense that the convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saussure&quot;/&gt;\n\nThus, languages must have a [[vocabulary]] of signs related to specific meaning. The English sign &quot;dog&quot; denotes, for example, a member of the species ''[[Canis familiaris]]''. In a language, the array of arbitrary signs connected to specific meanings is called the [[lexicon]], and a single sign connected to a meaning is called a [[lexeme]]. Not all meanings in a language are represented by single words. Often, semantic concepts are embedded in the morphology or syntax of the language in the form of [[Grammatical category|grammatical categories]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Levinson 1983&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAll languages contain the semantic structure of [[predicate (grammar)|predication]]: a structure that predicates a property, state, or action. Traditionally, semantics has been understood to be the study of how speakers and interpreters assign [[truth value]]s to statements, so that meaning is understood to be the process by which a predicate can be said to be true or false about an entity, e.g. &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[x [is y]]&quot; or &quot;[x [does y]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;. Recently, this model of semantics has been complemented with more dynamic models of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the context in which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning. Such models of meaning are explored in the field of [[pragmatics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Levinson 1983&quot;/&gt;\n\n===Sounds and symbols===\n{{main|Phonology|Writing|}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 150\n| image1    = ManSpec.png\n| caption1  = A spectrogram showing the sound of the spoken English word &quot;man&quot;, which is written phonetically as {{ipa|[m\u00e6n]}}.

The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in [[phonology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Goldsmith|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSounds as part of a linguistic system are called [[phonemes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonemes are abstract units of sound, defined as the smallest units in a language that can serve to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally different words, a so-called [[minimal pair]]. In English, for example, the words ''bat'' {{ipa|[b\u00e6t]}} and ''pat'' {{ipa|[p\u02b0\u00e6t]}} form a minimal pair, in which the distinction between {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/p/}} differentiates the two words, which have different meanings. However, each language contrasts sounds in different ways. For example, in a language that does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants, the sounds {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[b]}} (if they both occur) could be considered a single phoneme, and consequently, the two pronunciations would have the same meaning. Similarly, the English language does not distinguish phonemically between [[aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated and non-aspirated]] pronunciations of consonants, as many other languages like [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Hindi]] do: the unaspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in ''spin'' {{ipa|[sp\u026an]}} and the aspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in ''pin'' {{ipa|[p\u02b0\u026an]}} are considered to be merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme (such variants of a single phoneme are called [[allophones]]), whereas in [[Mandarin Chinese]], the same difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words {{ipa|[p\u02b0\u00e1]}} 'crouch' and {{ipa|[p\u00e1]}} 'eight' (the accent above the \u00e1 means that the vowel is pronounced with a high tone).&lt;ref name=&quot;Trask214&quot;/&gt;\n\nAll [[oral language|spoken languages]] have phonemes of at least two different categories, [[vowels]] and [[consonants]], that can be combined to form [[syllable]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacMahon5&quot;/&gt; As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[pitch accent|pitch]], [[Vowel length|duration]], and [[tonal language|tone]] to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments, they are called [[suprasegmental]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example, [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]] and [[Pirah\u00e3 language]] with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like [[Taa language#Phonology|Taa]] may have as many as 141 phonemes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trask214&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sign language]]s, [[Phoneme#Phonemes in sign languages|the equivalent to phonemes]] (formerly called [[chereme]]s) are defined by the basic elements of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, William C.

The [[Latin alphabet]] (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the [[Inuktitut]] syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In [[logographic]] scripts, each sign represents an entire word,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in spoken language.\n\nBecause all languages have a very large number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the [[Arabic script]]), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coulmas&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Coulmas|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn order to represent the sounds of the world's languages in writing, linguists have developed the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], designed to represent all of the discrete sounds that are known to contribute to meaning in human languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Grammar===\n{{main|Grammar}}\nGrammar is the study of how meaningful elements called ''[[morpheme]]s'' within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be ''free'' or ''bound''. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called ''[[word]]s'', and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called [[affix]]es. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The study of the rules for the internal structure of words are called [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called ''syntax''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====Grammatical categories====\n{{main|Grammatical category}}\nGrammar can be described as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Allerton|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically [[morphosyntactic alignment|distinguishing between their relations]] to a predicate, the encoding of [[Grammatical tense|temporal]] and [[Preposition and postposition|spatial]] relations on predicates, and a system of [[grammatical person]] governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Payne|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====Word classes====\nLanguages organize their [[parts of speech]] into classes according to their functions and positions relative to other parts. All languages, for instance, make a basic distinction between a group of words that prototypically denotes things and concepts and a group of words that prototypically denotes actions and events. The first group, which includes English words such as &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;song&quot;, are usually called [[noun]]s. The second, which includes &quot;think&quot; and &quot;sing&quot;, are called [[verb]]s. Another common category is the [[adjective]]: words that describe properties or qualities of nouns, such as &quot;red&quot; or &quot;big&quot;. Word classes can be &quot;open&quot; if new words can continuously be added to the class, or relatively &quot;closed&quot; if there is a fixed number of words in a class. In English, the class of pronouns is closed, whereas the class of adjectives is open, since an infinite number of adjectives can be constructed from verbs (e.g. &quot;saddened&quot;) or nouns (e.g. with the -like suffix, as in &quot;noun-like&quot;). In other languages such as [[Korean language|Korean]], the situation is the opposite, and new pronouns can be constructed, whereas the number of adjectives is fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWord classes also carry out differing functions in grammar. Prototypically, verbs are used to construct [[predicate (grammar)|predicates]], while nouns are used as [[argument (linguistics)|argument]]s of predicates. In a sentence such as &quot;Sally runs&quot;, the predicate is &quot;runs&quot;, because it is the word that predicates a specific state about its argument &quot;Sally&quot;. Some verbs such as &quot;curse&quot; can take two arguments, e.g. &quot;Sally cursed John&quot;. A predicate that can only take a single argument is called [[transitivity (grammar)|''intransitive'']], while a predicate that can take two arguments is called [[transitive verb|''transitive'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nMany other word classes exist in different languages, such as [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions]] like &quot;and&quot; that serve to join two sentences, [[article (grammar)|articles]] that introduce a noun, [[interjections]] such as &quot;wow!&quot;, or [[ideophones]] like &quot;splash&quot; that mimic the sound of some event. Some languages have positionals that describe the spatial position of an event or entity. Many languages have [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] that identify countable nouns as belonging to a particular type or having a particular shape. For instance, in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the general noun classifier for humans is ''nin'' (\u4eba), and it is used for counting humans, whatever they are called:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Senft|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n:''san-nin no gakusei'' (\u4e09\u4eba\u306e\u5b66\u751f) lit. &quot;3 human-classifier of student&quot;&amp;nbsp;\u2014 three students\nFor trees, it would be:\n:''san-bon no ki'' (\u4e09\u672c\u306e\u6728) lit. &quot;3 classifier-for-long-objects of tree&quot;&amp;nbsp;\u2014 three trees\n\n====Morphology====\nIn linguistics, the study of the internal structure of complex words and the processes by which words are formed is called [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. In most languages, it is possible to construct complex words that are built of several [[morpheme]]s. For instance, the English word &quot;unexpected&quot; can be analyzed as being composed of the three morphemes &quot;un-&quot;, &quot;expect&quot; and &quot;-ed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aronoff|Fudeman|2011|pp=1\u20132}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nMorphemes can be classified according to whether they are independent morphemes, so-called [[Root (linguistics)|roots]], or whether they can only co-occur attached to other morphemes. These bound morphemes or [[affix]]es can be classified according to their position in relation to the root: ''[[prefix]]es'' precede the root, [[suffix]]es follow the root, and [[infix]]es are inserted in the middle of a root. Affixes serve to modify or elaborate the meaning of the root. Some languages change the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure of a word, for example, the English word &quot;run&quot;, which in the past tense is &quot;ran&quot;. This process is called ''[[ablaut]]''. Furthermore, morphology distinguishes between the process of [[inflection]], which modifies or elaborates on a word, and the process of [[Morphological derivation|derivation]], which creates a new word from an existing one. In English, the verb &quot;sing&quot; has the inflectional forms &quot;singing&quot; and &quot;sung&quot;, which are both verbs, and the derivational form &quot;singer&quot;, which is a noun derived from the verb with the agentive suffix &quot;-er&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Bauer|2003}}; {{harvcoltxt|Haspelmath|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLanguages differ widely in how much they rely on morphological processes of word formation. In some languages, for example, Chinese, there are no morphological processes, and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type of morpho-syntax is often called [[Isolating language|isolating]], or analytic, because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in the degree to which morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments. For example, in Latin, the word ''bonus'', or &quot;good&quot;, consists of the root ''bon-'', meaning &quot;good&quot;, and the suffix -''us'', which indicates masculine gender, singular number, and [[nominative]] case. These languages are called ''[[fusional languages]]'', because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite of fusional languages are [[agglutinative languages]] which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit. An example of such a language is [[Turkish language|Turkish]], where for example, the word ''evlerinizden'', or &quot;from your houses&quot;, consists of the morphemes, ''ev-ler-iniz-den'' with the meanings ''house-plural-your-from''. The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called [[polysynthetic languages]]. They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example, in [[Persian language|Persian]] the single word ''nafahmidamesh'' means ''I didn't understand it'' consisting of morphemes ''na-fahm-id-am-esh'' with the meanings, &quot;negation.understand.past.I.it&quot;. As another example with more complexity, in the [[Yupik language|Yupik]] word ''tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq'', which means &quot;He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer&quot;, the word consists of the morphemes ''tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq'' with the meanings, &quot;reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative&quot;, and except for the morpheme ''tuntu'' (&quot;reindeer&quot;) none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Payne|1997|pp=28\u201329}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nMany languages use morphology to cross-reference words within a sentence. This is sometimes called ''[[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]]''. For example, in many Indo-European languages, adjectives must cross-reference the noun they modify in terms of number, case, and gender, so that the Latin adjective ''bonus'', or &quot;good&quot;, is inflected to agree with a noun that is masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. In many polysynthetic languages, verbs cross-reference their subjects and objects. In these types of languages, a single verb may include information that would require an entire sentence in English. For example, in the [[Basque language|Basque]] phrase ''ikusi nauzu'', or &quot;you saw me&quot;, the past tense auxiliary verb ''n-au-zu'' (similar to English &quot;do&quot;) agrees with both the subject (you) expressed by the ''n''- prefix, and with the object (me) expressed by the \u2013 ''zu'' suffix. The sentence could be directly transliterated as &quot;see you-did-me&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====Syntax====\n{{main|Syntax}}\n[[File:Constituent structure analysis English sentence.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|In addition to word classes, a sentence can be analyzed in terms of grammatical functions: &quot;The cat&quot; is the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the phrase, &quot;on the mat&quot; is a [[locative (case)|locative]] phrase, and &quot;sat&quot; is the core of the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]].]]\n\nAnother way in which languages convey meaning is through the order of words within a sentence. The grammatical rules for how to produce new sentences from words that are already known is called syntax. The syntactical rules of a language determine why a sentence in English such as &quot;I love you&quot; is meaningful, but &quot;*love you I&quot; is not.{{refn|group=note|The prefixed asterisk * conventionally indicates that the sentence is ungrammatical, i.e. syntactically incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denham|first1=Kristin |last2=Lobeck|first2=Anne|title=Linguistics for Everyone: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0KVSvqvZKYC&amp;pg=PA9|date=6 March 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-4130-1589-8|page=9|quote=An ''ungrammatical'' sentence is one that is impossible in a given language, one that a native speaker of that variety would never utter naturally. (Remember that ungrammatical sentences are marked with an asterisk, *.}}&lt;/ref&gt; }} Syntactical rules determine how word order and sentence structure is constrained, and how those constraints contribute to meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Baker|2001|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in English, the two sentences &quot;the slaves were cursing the master&quot; and &quot;the master was cursing the slaves&quot; mean different things, because the role of the grammatical subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the verb, and the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb. Conversely, in [[Latin language|Latin]], both ''Dominus servos vituperabat'' and ''Servos vituperabat dominus'' mean &quot;the master was reprimanding the slaves&quot;, because ''servos'', or &quot;slaves&quot;, is in the [[accusative case]], showing that they are the [[Object (grammar)|grammatical object]] of the sentence, and ''dominus'', or &quot;master&quot;, is in the [[nominative case]], showing that he is the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLatin uses morphology to express the distinction between subject and object, whereas English uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of [[Wh-movement|inverse word order in questions]], which exists in many languages. This rule explains why when in English, the phrase &quot;John is talking to Lucy&quot; is turned into a question, it becomes &quot;Who is John talking to?&quot;, and not &quot;John is talking to who?&quot;. The latter example may be used as a way of placing [[focus (linguistics)|special emphasis]] on &quot;who&quot;, thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in units, called [[phrase]]s, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure. Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure, connecting the phrases to each other at different levels.{{sfn|Baker|2001|pp=269\u201370}} To the right is a graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence &quot;the cat sat on the mat&quot;. The sentence is analyzed as being constituted by a noun phrase, a verb, and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase, and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trask 2007 218\u201319&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=218\u201319}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe reason sentences can be seen as being composed of phrases is because each phrase would be moved around as a single element if syntactic operations were carried out. For example, &quot;the cat&quot; is one phrase, and &quot;on the mat&quot; is another, because they would be treated as single units if a decision was made to emphasize the location by moving forward the prepositional phrase: &quot;[And] on the mat, the cat sat&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trask 2007 218\u201319&quot;/&gt; There are many different formalist and functionalist frameworks that propose theories for describing syntactic structures, based on different assumptions about what language is and how it should be described. Each of them would analyze a sentence such as this in a different manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewmeyerForm&quot;/&gt;\n\n===Typology and universals===\n{{Main|Linguistic typology|Linguistic universal}}\n\nLanguages can be classified in relation to their grammatical types. Languages that belong to different families nonetheless often have features in common, and these shared features tend to correlate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Nichols|1992}};{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, languages can be classified on the basis of their basic [[word order]], the relative order of the [[verb]], and its constituents in a normal indicative [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. In English, the basic order is [[Subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]] (subject\u2013verb\u2013object): &quot;The snake(S) bit(V) the man(O)&quot;, whereas for example, the corresponding sentence in the [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Australian language]] [[Gamilaraay language|Gamilaraay]] would be ''d\u032auyugu n\u032aama d\u032aayn yi\u02d0y'' (snake man bit), [[Subject-object-verb|SOV]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CroftErg&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|2001|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Word order type is relevant as a typological parameter, because basic word order type corresponds with other syntactic parameters, such as the relative order of nouns and adjectives, or of the use of [[prepositions]] or [[postpositions]]. Such correlations are called [[Linguistic universals|implicational universals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Greenberg|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, most (but not all) languages that are of the [[Subject-object-verb|SOV]] type have postpositions rather than prepositions, and have adjectives before nouns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|2009|p=45}}; {{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1994|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAll languages structure sentences into Subject, Verb, and Object, but languages differ in the way they classify the relations between actors and actions. English uses the [[Nominative\u2013accusative language|nominative-accusative]] word typology: in English transitive clauses, the subjects of both intransitive sentences (&quot;I run&quot;) and transitive sentences (&quot;I love you&quot;) are treated in the same way, shown here by the nominative pronoun ''I''. Some languages, called [[Ergativity|ergative]], Gamilaraay among them, distinguish instead between Agents and Patients. In ergative languages, the single participant in an intransitive sentence, such as &quot;I run&quot;, is treated the same as the patient in a transitive sentence, giving the equivalent of &quot;me run&quot;. Only in transitive sentences would the equivalent of the pronoun &quot;I&quot; be used.&lt;ref name=&quot;CroftErg&quot;/&gt; In this way the semantic roles can map onto the grammatical relations in different ways, grouping an intransitive subject either with Agents (accusative type) or Patients (ergative type) or even making each of the three roles differently, which is called the [[Tripartite language|tripartite type]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|2001|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe shared features of languages which belong to the same typological class type may have arisen completely independently. Their co-occurrence might be due to universal laws governing the structure of natural languages, &quot;language universals&quot;, or they might be the result of languages evolving convergent solutions to the recurring communicative problems that humans use language to solve.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myths&quot;/&gt;\n\n==Social contexts of use and transmission==\n[[File:Place des Abbesse (the plaque with the je t'aime=te iubesc in 311 laguages).jpg|thumb|''[[Wall of Love]]'' on [[Montmartre]] in Paris: &quot;I love you&quot; in 250 languages, by calligraphist F\u00e9d\u00e9ric Baron and artist Claire Kito (2000)]]\nWhile humans have the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an environment in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on [[speech community|communities of speakers]] in which children [[language acquisition|learn language]] from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to [[communicate]] and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myths&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Evans|Levinson|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the way in which language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to [[language contact]]. The process is similar to the process of [[evolution]], where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a [[phylogenetic tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHowever, languages differ from biological organisms in that they readily incorporate elements from other languages through the process of [[diffusion]], as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their [[first language]] or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming [[endangered language|endangered]] as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt;\n\n===Usage and meaning===\n{{main|Pragmatics}}\n\nWhen studying the way in which words and signs are used, it is often the case that words have different meanings, depending on the social context of use. An important example of this is the process called [[deixis]], which describes the way in which certain words refer to entities through their relation between a specific point in time and space when the word is uttered. Such words are, for example, the word, &quot;I&quot; (which designates the person speaking), &quot;now&quot; (which designates the moment of speaking), and &quot;here&quot; (which designates the position of speaking). Signs also change their meanings over time, as the conventions governing their usage gradually change. The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions changes depending on context is called pragmatics. Deixis is an important part of the way that we use language to point out entities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=54\u201396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning. For example, in all languages, linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information, but to perform actions. Certain actions are made only through language, but nonetheless have tangible effects, e.g. the act of &quot;naming&quot;, which creates a new name for some entity, or the act of &quot;pronouncing someone man and wife&quot;, which creates a social contract of marriage. These types of acts are called [[speech act]]s, although they can also be carried out through writing or hand signing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=226\u201378}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe form of linguistic expression often does not correspond to the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner table a person asks, &quot;Can you reach the salt?&quot;, that is, in fact, not a question about the length of the arms of the one being addressed, but a request to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken; these kinds of effects of meaning are called [[conversational implicature]]s. These social rules for which ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation to their context vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring [[communicative competence]] in a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=100\u201369}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Acquisition===\n{{main|Language acquisition|Second-language acquisition|Second language|Language education}}\nAll healthy, [[Human development (biology)|normally developing]] human beings learn to use language. Children acquire the language or languages used around them: whichever languages they receive sufficient exposure to during childhood. The development is essentially the same for children acquiring [[sign language|sign]] or [[oral language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bonvillian |first1=John D. |author2=Michael D.

In ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'', naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] called this process &quot;an instinctive tendency to acquire an art&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Language Instinct&quot;/&gt;\n[[File:Kituwah Academy.png|thumb|A lesson at [[Kituwah Academy]], a school where English and the [[Cherokee language]] are [[mediums of instruction]]]]\n\nFirst language acquisition proceeds in a fairly regular sequence, though there is a wide degree of variation in the timing of particular stages among normally developing infants. Studies published in 2013 have indicated that unborn [[fetus]]es are capable of language acquisition to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;First Impressions: We start to pick up words, food preferences and hand-eye coordination long before being born&quot;, ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 1 (July 2015), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beth Skwarecki, &quot;Babies Learn to Recognize Words in the Womb&quot;, ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 26 August 2013 [http://news.sciencemag.org/brain-behavior/2013/08/babies-learn-recognize-words-womb]&lt;/ref&gt; From birth, newborns respond more readily to human speech than to other sounds. Around one month of age, babies appear to be able to distinguish between different [[Phone (phonetics)|speech sounds]]. Around six months of age, a child will begin [[babbling]], producing the speech sounds or [[handshape]]s of the languages used around them. Words appear around the age of 12 to 18 months; the average [[vocabulary]] of an eighteen-month-old child is around 50 [[word]]s. A child's first [[utterance]]s are [[Holophrasis|holophrases]] (literally &quot;whole-sentences&quot;), utterances that use just one word to communicate some idea. Several months after a child begins producing words, he or she will produce two-word utterances, and within a few more months will begin to produce [[telegraphic speech]], or short sentences that are less [[Grammar|grammatically]] complex than adult speech, but that do show regular syntactic structure. From roughly the age of three to five years, a child's ability to speak or sign is refined to the point that it resembles adult language.&lt;ref name=&quot;OGrady-Cho&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last1=O'Grady |first1=William |last2=Cho |first2=Sook Whan |chapter=First language acquisition |title=Contemporary Linguistics: An Introduction |edition=fourth |location=Boston |publisher=Bedford St. Martin's |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kennison&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Kennison|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAcquisition of second and additional languages can come at any age, through exposure in daily life or courses. Children learning a second language are more likely to achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Macaro|editor-first1=Ernesto| year=2010 | title=Continuum companion to second language acquisition|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-1-4411-9922-5|pages=137\u201357}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Culture===\n{{see also|Culture#Language_and_culture|l1=Culture|Speech community}}\n[[File:Arnold Lakhovsky Conversation.png|thumb|right|[[Arnold Lakhovsky]], ''The Conversation'' (c. 1935)]]\nLanguages, understood as the particular set of speech norms of a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that speaks them. Languages differ not only in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, but also through having different &quot;cultures of speaking.&quot; Humans use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group as well as difference from others. Even among speakers of one language, several different ways of using the language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger culture. Linguists and anthropologists, particularly [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguists]], [[Anthropological linguistics|ethnolinguists]], and [[Linguistic anthropology|linguistic anthropologists]] have specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between [[Speech community|speech communities]].&lt;ref name=Duranti2003&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Duranti|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLinguists use the term &quot;[[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]]&quot; to refer to the different ways of speaking a language. This term includes geographically or socioculturally defined [[dialect]]s as well as the [[register (sociolinguistics)|jargons]] or [[style shifting|styles]] of [[subculture]]s. Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foley&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nBecause norms for language use are shared by members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status as a second language speaker. These kinds of differences are not part of the linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Agha|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHowever, many languages also have grammatical conventions that signal the social position of the speaker in relation to others through the use of registers that are related to social hierarchies or divisions. In many languages, there are stylistic or even grammatical differences between the ways men and women speak, between age groups, or between [[social class]]es, just as some languages employ different words depending on who is listening. For example, in the Australian language [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]], a married man must use a special set of words to refer to everyday items when speaking in the presence of his mother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dixon|1972|pp=32\u201334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cultures, for example, have elaborate systems of &quot;social [[deixis]]&quot;, or systems of signalling social distance through linguistic means.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foley 1997 p&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997|pp=311\u201328}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, social deixis is shown mostly through distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname, and in titles such as &quot;Mrs.&quot;, &quot;boy&quot;, &quot;Doctor&quot;, or &quot;Your Honor&quot;, but in other languages, such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language. For instance, in languages of east Asia such as [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and [[Old Javanese|Javanese]], different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foley 1997 p&quot;/&gt;\n\n===Writing, literacy and technology===\n{{main|Writing|Literacy}}\n[[File:Winnipeg Forks - Plains Cree Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|An inscription of [[Swampy Cree language|Swampy Cree]] using [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]], an [[abugida]] developed by Christian missionaries for Indigenous Canadian languages]]\nThroughout history a number of different ways of representing language in graphic media have been invented. These are called [[writing systems]].\n\nThe use of writing has made language even more useful to humans. It makes it possible to store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and [[formal education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Olson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[4th millennium BC]]. The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform script]] and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered to be the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400\u20133200 BC with the earliest coherent texts from about 2600 BC. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of [[cultural diffusion]]. A similar debate exists for the [[Chinese script]], which developed around 1200 BC. The [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] (including among others [[Olmec]] and [[Maya script]]s) are generally believed to have had independent origins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coulmas&quot;/&gt;\n\n===Change===\n{{main|Language change|Grammaticalization}}\n[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|upright|The first page of the poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', written in [[Old English]] in the early medieval period (800\u20131100 AD). Although Old English is the direct ancestor of modern English, it is unintelligible to contemporary English speakers.]]\nAll languages change as speakers adopt or invent new ways of speaking and pass them on to other members of their speech community. Language change happens at all levels from the phonological level to the levels of vocabulary, morphology, syntax, and discourse. Even though language change is often initially evaluated negatively by speakers of the language who often consider changes to be &quot;decay&quot; or a sign of slipping norms of language usage, it is natural and inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aitchison|2001}}; {{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nChanges may affect specific sounds or the entire [[Phonological change|phonological system]]. [[Sound change]] can consist of the replacement of one speech sound or [[distinctive feature|phonetic feature]] by another, the complete loss of the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none. Sound changes can be ''conditioned'' in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be ''regular'', which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be ''sporadic'', affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a [[chain shift]] in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the [[Germanic languages]] when the sound change known as [[Grimm's law]] affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant *{{PIE|b\u02b0}} became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous *{{PIE|b}} in turn became /p/, and the previous *{{PIE|p}} became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why [[Italic languages]] such as Latin have ''p'' in words like '''''p'''ater'' and '''''p'''isces'', whereas Germanic languages, like English, have '''''f'''ather'' and '''''f'''ish''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Clackson|2007|pp=27\u201333}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAnother example is the [[Great Vowel Shift]] in English, which is the reason that the spelling of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin ''mea domina'' to eventually become the [[French language|French]] ''madame'' and American English ''ma'am''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aitchison|2001|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nChange also happens in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as [[idiom]]s or particular constructions become [[grammaticalized]]. This frequently happens when words or morphemes erode and the grammatical system is unconsciously rearranged to compensate for the lost element. For example, in some varieties of [[Caribbean Spanish]] the final /s/ has eroded away. Since [[Standard Spanish]] uses final /s/ in the morpheme marking the [[grammatical person|second person]] subject &quot;you&quot; in verbs, the Caribbean varieties now have to express the second person using the pronoun ''t\u00fa''. This means that the sentence &quot;what's your name&quot; is ''\u00bfcomo te llamas?'' {{ipa|[\u02c8komo te \u02c8jamas]}} in Standard Spanish, but {{ipa|[\u02c8komo \u02c8tu te \u02c8jama]}} in Caribbean Spanish. The simple sound change has affected both morphology and syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Zentella|2002|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual petrification of idioms into new grammatical forms, for example, the way the English &quot;going to&quot; construction lost its aspect of movement and in some varieties of English has almost become a full-fledged future tense (e.g. ''I'm gonna'').\n\nLanguage change may be motivated by &quot;language internal&quot; factors, such as changes in pronunciation motivated by certain sounds being difficult to distinguish aurally or to produce, or through patterns of change that cause some rare types of constructions to [[Drift (linguistics)|drift]] towards more common types.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other causes of language change are social, such as when certain pronunciations become emblematic of membership in certain groups, such as social classes, or with [[Language ideology|ideologies]], and therefore are adopted by those who wish to identify with those groups or ideas. In this way, issues of identity and politics can have profound effects on language structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Contact===\n{{main|language contact}}\nOne important source of language change is contact and resulting [[Trans-cultural diffusion|diffusion]] of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs when speakers of two or more languages or [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] interact on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Thomason|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Multilingualism]] is likely to have been the norm throughout [[human history]] and most people in the modern world are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the [[Nation state|ethno-national state]], monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the ideology that made one people, one state, and one language the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Romaine|2001|p=513}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWhen speakers of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence each other. Through sustained language contact over long periods, linguistic traits diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different families may converge to become more similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact, this may lead to the formation of [[Sprachbund|language areas]] in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A number of such language areas have been documented, among them, the [[Balkan language area]], the [[Mesoamerican language area]], and the [[Ethiopian language area]]. Also, larger areas such as [[South Asia]], Europe, and Southeast Asia have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of specific [[areal feature (linguistics)|areal features]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aikhenvald|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLanguage contact may also lead to a variety of other linguistic phenomena, including [[language convergence]], [[loanword|borrowing]], and [[relexification]] (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In situations of extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation of new [[mixed language]]s that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called [[pidgins]] occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case, they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a [[creole language]]. An example of such mixed languages is [[Tok Pisin]], the official language of [[Papua New-Guinea]], which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and [[Austronesian languages]]; others are [[Haitian Creole|Krey\u00f2l ayisyen]], the French-based creole language spoken in [[Haiti]], and [[Michif language|Michif]], a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language [[Cree language|Cree]] and French.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Thomason|Kaufman|1988}}; {{harvcoltxt|Thomason|2001}}; {{harvcoltxt|Matras|Bakker|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Linguistic diversity==\n{{See also|Lists of languages|List of languages by total number of speakers}}\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width: 200px; float: right; margin:10px&quot;\n|-\n!

The exact number of known living languages varies from 6,000 to 7,000, depending on the precision of one's definition of &quot;language&quot;, and in particular, on how one defines the distinction between languages and [[dialects]]. As of 2016, ''Ethnologue'' cataloged 7,097 living human languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics|title = Ethnologue statistics|website = Summary by world area {{!}} Ethnologue|publisher = SIL|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ethnologue'' establishes linguistic groups based on studies of [[mutual intelligibility]], and therefore often includes more categories than more conservative classifications. For example, the [[Danish language]] that most scholars consider a single language with several dialects is classified as two distinct languages (Danish and [[Jutlandic dialect|Jutish]]) by the ''Ethnologue''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ethnologue&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAccording to the ''Ethnologue'', 389 languages (nearly 6%) have more than a million speakers.

Before the [[Yugoslav civil war]], [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] was generally considered a single language with two normative variants, but due to sociopolitical reasons, [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] are now often treated as separate languages and employ different writing systems. In other words, the distinction may hinge on political considerations as much as on cultural differences, distinctive [[writing system]]s, or degree of [[mutual intelligibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Language families of the world===\n{{Main|Language family|Dialectology|Historical linguistics|List of language families}}\n[[File:Primary Human Language Families Map.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Principal language families of the world (and in some cases geographic groups of families).

[[Language loss]] occurs when the language has no more native speakers, and becomes a ''[[dead language]]''. If eventually no one speaks the language at all, it becomes an ''[[extinct language]]''. While languages have always gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes of [[globalization]] and [[neo-colonialism]], where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt;\n\nThe more commonly spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations.

Notwithstanding claims that the world would be better off if most adopted a single common ''[[lingua franca]]'', such as English or [[Esperanto]], there is a consensus that the loss of languages harms the cultural diversity of the world. It is a common belief, going back to the biblical narrative of the [[tower of Babel]] in the [[Old Testament]], that linguistic diversity causes political conflict,&lt;ref name=&quot;Haugen&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Haugen|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is contradicted by the fact that many of the world's major episodes of violence have taken place in situations with low linguistic diversity, such as the [[Yugoslav Wars|Yugoslav]] and [[American Civil War]], or the genocide of [[Rwanda]], whereas many of the most stable political units have been highly multilingual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011|pp=10\u201311}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nMany projects aim to prevent or slow this loss by [[language revitalization|revitalizing]] endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries have enacted [[Language policy|specific legislation]] to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous [[speech community|speech communities]].

Other definitions sometimes include non-cellular life forms such as [[Virus|viruses]] and [[Viroid|viroids]].\n\n[[Abiogenesis]] is the natural process of life arising from non-living matter, such as simple [[organic compounds]]. The prevailing scientific hypothesis is that the transition from non-living to living entities was not a single event, but a gradual process of increasing complexity. Life on Earth [[Earliest known life forms|first appeared]] as early as 4.28 billion years ago, soon after [[Origin of water on Earth#Water in the development of Earth|ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago]], and not long after the [[Age of the Earth|formation of the Earth]] 4.54 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAT-20170301&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20170301&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-20170301&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;4.3b oldest&quot; /&gt; The earliest known life forms are microfossils of bacteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;WU-20171218&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Tyrell |first=Kelly April |title=Oldest fossils ever found show life on Earth began before 3.5 billion years ago |url=https://news.wisc.edu/oldest-fossils-ever-found-show-life-on-earth-began-before-3-5-billion-years-ago/ |date=18 December 2017 |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] |accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PNAS-2017&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schopf |first1=J.

Some microorganisms, called [[extremophile]]s, thrive in physically or geochemically [[extreme environment]]s that are detrimental to most other life on Earth. The [[Cell (biology)|cell]] is considered the structural and functional unit of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2.2: The Basic Structural and Functional Unit of Life: The Cell |url=https://med.libretexts.org/Courses/American_Public_University/APUS%3A_An_Introduction_to_Nutrition_(Byerley)/Text/03%3A_Nutrition_and_the_Human_Body/2.2%3A_The_Basic_Structural_and_Functional_Unit_of_Life%3A_The_Cell |publisher=LibreTexts |date=2 June 2019 |accessdate=29 March 2020 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bose |first=Debopriya |title=Six Main Cell Functions |url=https://sciencing.com/six-main-cell-functions-6891800.html |publisher=Leaf Group Ltd./Leaf Group Media |date=14 May 2019 |accessdate=29 March 2020 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two kinds of cells, [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] and [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]], both of which consist of [[cytoplasm]] enclosed within a [[membrane]] and contain many [[biomolecules]] such as [[proteins]] and [[nucleic acid]]s. Cells reproduce through a process of [[cell division]], in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells.\n\nIn the past, there have been many attempts to define what is meant by &quot;life&quot; through obsolete concepts such as [[odic force]], [[hylomorphism]], [[spontaneous generation]] and [[vitalism]], that have now been disproved by [[Biological research|biological discoveries]]. [[Aristotle]] is considered to be the first person to [[taxonomy (biology)|classify]] organisms. Later, [[Carl Linnaeus]] introduced [[Linnean taxonomy|his system]] of [[binomial nomenclature]] for the classification of [[species]]. Eventually new groups and categories of life were discovered, such as cells and microorganisms, forcing dramatic revisions of the structure of relationships between living organisms. Though currently only known on [[Earth]], life need not be restricted to it, and many scientists speculate in the existence of [[extraterrestrial life]]. [[Artificial life]] is a computer simulation or human-made reconstruction of any aspect of life, which is often used to examine systems related to natural life.\n\nDeath is the permanent termination of all [[Biological process|biological functions]] which sustain an organism, and as such, is the end of its life. [[Extinction]] is the term describing the dying out of a group or [[taxon]], usually a [[species]]. [[Fossil]]s are the preserved remains or [[trace fossil|traces]] of organisms.\n\n==Definitions==\nThe definition of life has long been a challenge for scientists and philosophers, with many varied definitions put forward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Definitions 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Why Is the Definition of Life So Elusive?

The application of hylomorphism to biology was important to Aristotle, and [[Aristotle's biology|biology is extensively covered in his extant writings]]. In this view, everything in the material universe has both matter and form, and the form of a living thing is its [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Greek ''psyche'', Latin ''anima''). There are three kinds of souls: the ''vegetative soul'' of plants, which causes them to grow and decay and nourish themselves, but does not cause motion and sensation; the ''animal soul'', which causes animals to move and feel; and the ''rational soul'', which is the source of consciousness and reasoning, which (Aristotle believed) is found only in man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=On the Soul |last=Aristotle |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=Book II |nopp=y |chapter= |quote= |via=|title-link=On the Soul }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each higher soul has all of the attributes of the lower ones.

DNA and [[RNA]] are [[nucleic acid]]s; alongside [[protein]]s and [[Polysaccharide|complex carbohydrates]], they are one of the three major types of [[macromolecules|macromolecule]] that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two [[biopolymer]] strands coiled around each other to form a [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix]]. The two DNA strands are known as [[polynucleotide]]s since they are composed of [[monomer|simpler units]] called [[nucleotide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna |title=DNA |date=5 February 2016 |website=Basic Biology |access-date=15 November 2016 |last1=Purcell |first1=Adam |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105045651/http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna/ |archivedate=5 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each nucleotide is composed of a [[nitrogenous base|nitrogen-containing]] [[nucleobase]]\u2014either [[cytosine]] (C), [[guanine]] (G), [[adenine]] (A), or [[thymine]] (T)\u2014as well as a [[monosaccharide|sugar]] called [[deoxyribose]] and a [[phosphate group]]. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by [[covalent bond]]s between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating [[backbone chain|sugar-phosphate backbone]]. According to [[base pair]]ing rules (A with T, and C with G), [[hydrogen bond]]s bind the nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA [[base pair]]s on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;, and weighs 50 billion [[tonne]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20150718-rn&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--- PLOS paper cited by NYT used 'tonne' unit. ---&gt; In comparison, the total [[Biomass (ecology)|mass]] of the [[biosphere]] has been estimated to be as much as 4 [[tonnes#Derived units|TtC]] (trillion tons of [[carbon]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;AGCI-2015&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--- Aspen Global Change Institute (US-based) defined TtC as 'trillion tons of C'. ---&gt;\n\nDNA stores biological information. The DNA backbone is resistant to cleavage, and both strands of the double-stranded structure store the same biological information. Biological information is replicated as the two strands are separated. A significant portion of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is [[non-coding DNA|non-coding]], meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences.\n\nThe two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are therefore [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|anti-parallel]]. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally, ''bases''). It is the [[Nucleic acid sequence|sequence]] of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information. Under the [[genetic code]], [[RNA]] strands are translated to specify the sequence of [[amino acid]]s within proteins. These RNA strands are initially created using DNA strands as a template in a process called [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]].\n\nWithin cells, DNA is organized into long structures called [[chromosome]]s. During [[cell division]] these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of [[DNA replication]], providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes. [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic organisms]] (animals, plants, [[Fungus|fungi]], and [[protist]]s) store most of their DNA inside the [[cell nucleus]] and some of their DNA in [[organelle]]s, such as [[mitochondria]] or [[chloroplasts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Peter |title=iGenetics |url=https://archive.org/details/igenetics0000russ_v6o1 |url-access=registration |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8053-4553-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[prokaryote]]s (bacteria and [[archaea]]) store their DNA only in the [[cytoplasm]].

He also distinguished animals with blood from animals without blood (or at least without red blood), which can be compared with the concepts of [[vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s respectively, and divided the blooded animals into five groups: viviparous quadrupeds ([[mammal]]s), oviparous quadrupeds (reptiles and [[amphibian]]s), birds, fishes and [[Cetacea|whales]]. The bloodless animals were also divided into five groups: [[cephalopod]]s, [[crustacean]]s, insects (which included the spiders, [[scorpion]]s, and [[centipede]]s, in addition to what we define as insects today), shelled animals (such as most [[mollusc]]s and [[echinoderm]]s), and &quot;[[zoophyte]]s&quot; (animals that resemble plants). Though Aristotle's work in zoology was not without errors, it was the grandest biological synthesis of the time and remained the ultimate authority for many centuries after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/aristotle.html|title=Aristotle|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology|via=|accessdate=15 November 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120124920/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/aristotle.html|archivedate=20 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Linnaean ===\nThe exploration of the Americas revealed large numbers of new plants and animals that needed descriptions and classification. In the latter part of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th, careful study of animals commenced and was gradually extended until it formed a sufficient body of knowledge to serve as an anatomical basis for classification.\n\nIn the late 1740s, [[Carl Linnaeus]] introduced his system of [[binomial nomenclature]] for the classification of species. Linnaeus attempted to improve the composition and reduce the length of the previously used many-worded names by abolishing unnecessary rhetoric, introducing new descriptive terms and precisely defining their meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Knapp S, Lamas G, Lughadha EN, Novarino G |title=Stability or stasis in the names of organisms: the evolving codes of nomenclature |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B]] |volume=359 |issue=1444 |pages=611\u201322 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15253348 |pmc=1693349 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2003.1445 |url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;issn=0962-8436&amp;volume=359&amp;issue=1444&amp;spage=611}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Linnaean classification has eight levels: domains, kingdoms, phyla, class, order, family, genus, and species.\n\nThe fungi were originally treated as plants.

[[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of [[conjecture]]s in both mathematics and the (other) sciences. [[Experimental mathematics]] continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.\n\nThe opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians&lt;ref&gt;See, for example [[Bertrand Russell]]'s statement &quot;Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty ...&quot; in his ''History of Western Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven [[liberal arts]]; others feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/mathematics|title=The science checklist applied: Mathematics|website=undsci.berkeley.edu|access-date=2019-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027021023/https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/mathematics|archive-date=October 27, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is ''created'' (as in art) or ''discovered'' (as in science). In practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borel|first=Armand|date=March 2017|title=Mathematics: Art and Science|journal=EMS Newsletter|volume=3|issue=103|pages=37\u201345|doi=10.4171/news/103/8|issn=1027-488X|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Inspiration, pure and applied mathematics, and aesthetics==\n{{main|Mathematical beauty}}\n\n{{multiple image\n|footer = [[Isaac Newton]] (left) and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] developed infinitesimal calculus.\n|total_width = 330\n|width1 = 407\n|height1 = 559\n|image1 = GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg\n|alt1 = Isaac Newton\n|width2 = 320\n|height2 = 390\n|image2 = Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg\n|alt2 = Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz}}\nMathematics arises from many different kinds of problems. At first these were found in commerce, [[land measurement]], architecture and later [[astronomy]]; today, all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians, and many problems arise within mathematics itself. For example, the [[physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]] invented the [[path integral formulation]] of [[quantum mechanics]] using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight, and today's [[string theory]], a still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces of nature]], continues to inspire new mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Feynman Integral and Feynman's Operational Calculus |journal=Physics Today |volume=54 |issue=8 |page=48 |author=Meinhard E.

But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts. A distinction is often made between [[pure mathematics]] and [[applied mathematics]]. However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications, e.g. [[number theory]] in [[cryptography]]. This remarkable fact, that even the &quot;purest&quot; mathematics often turns out to have practical applications, is what [[Eugene Wigner]] has called &quot;[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=wigner1960&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wigner |first=Eugene |year=1960 |title=The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |journal=[[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201314 |doi=10.1002/cpa.3160130102 |ref=harv |bibcode=1960CPAM...13....1W |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228152633/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |archivedate=February 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] runs to 46&amp;nbsp;pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |title=Mathematics Subject Classification 2010 |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514091144/http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including statistics, [[operations research]], and [[computer science]].\n\nFor those who are mathematically inclined, there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics. Many mathematicians talk about the ''elegance'' of mathematics, its intrinsic [[aesthetics]] and inner beauty. [[Simplicity]] and generality are valued. There is beauty in a simple and elegant [[proof (mathematics)|proof]], such as [[Euclid]]'s proof that there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and in an elegant [[numerical method]] that speeds calculation, such as the [[fast Fourier transform]]. [[G. H. Hardy]] in ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'' expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He identified criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Mathematician's Apology |author=Hardy, G. H. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1940 |isbn=978-0-521-42706-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematical research often seeks critical features of a mathematical object. A theorem expressed as a [[characterization (mathematics)|characterization]] of the object by these features is the prize. Examples of particularly succinct and revelatory mathematical arguments has been published in ''[[Proofs from THE BOOK]]''.\n\nThe popularity of [[recreational mathematics]] is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions. And at the other social extreme, philosophers continue to find problems in [[philosophy of mathematics]], such as the nature of [[mathematical proof]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Proof and Other Dilemmas: Mathematics and Philosophy |author1=Gold, Bonnie|author1-link=Bonnie Gold |author2=Simons, Rogers A. |publisher=MAA |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Notation, language, and rigor==\n{{main|Mathematical notation}}\n[[File:Leonhard Euler 2.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Leonhard Euler]] created and popularized much of the mathematical notation used today.]]\n\nMost of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |title=Earliest Uses of Various Mathematical Symbols |publisher= |accessdate=September 14, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220073955/http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |archivedate=February 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, mathematics was written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, p. 140, on [[Diophantus]]; p. 261, on [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (1707\u20131783) was responsible for many of the notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. According to [[Barbara Oakley]], this can be attributed to the fact that mathematical ideas are both more ''abstract'' and more ''encrypted'' than those of natural language.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley 2014, p. 16: &quot;Focused problem solving in math and science is often more effortful than focused-mode thinking involving language and people. This may be because humans haven't evolved over the millennia to manipulate mathematical ideas, which are frequently more abstractly encrypted than those of conventional language.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike natural language, where people can often equate a word (such as ''cow'') with the physical object it corresponds to, mathematical symbols are abstract, lacking any physical analog.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley 2014, p. 16: &quot;What do I mean by abstractness? You can point to a real live ''cow'' chewing its cud in a pasture and equate it with the letters ''c\u2013o\u2013w'' on the page. But you can't point to a real live ''plus sign'' that the symbol '+' is modeled after \u2013 the idea underlying the plus sign is more ''abstract''.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted than regular words, meaning a single symbol can encode a number of different operations or ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley 2014, p. 16: &quot;By ''encryptedness'', I mean that one symbol can stand for a number of different operations or ideas, just as the multiplication sign symbolizes repeated addition.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Language of mathematics|Mathematical language]] can be difficult to understand for beginners because even common terms, such as ''or'' and ''only'', have a more precise meaning than they have in everyday speech, and other terms such as ''[[open set|open]]'' and ''[[Field (mathematics)|field]]'' refer to specific mathematical ideas, not covered by their laymen's meanings. Mathematical language also includes many technical terms such as ''[[homeomorphism]]'' and ''[[Integral|integrable]]'' that have no meaning outside of mathematics. Additionally, shorthand phrases such as ''iff'' for &quot;[[if and only if]]&quot; belong to [[mathematical jargon]]. There is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as &quot;rigor&quot;.\n\n[[Mathematical proof]] is fundamentally a matter of [[rigor]]. Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This is to avoid mistaken &quot;[[theorem]]s&quot;, based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject.{{efn|See ''[[false proof]]'' for simple examples of what can go wrong in a formal proof.}} The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at the time of [[Isaac Newton]] the methods employed were less rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics&lt;!--This part needs improvement |&gt;&gt;--&gt;. Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about [[computer-assisted proof]]s. Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may be erroneous if the used computer program is erroneous.{{efn|For considering as reliable a large computation occurring in a proof, one generally requires two computations using independent software}}&lt;ref&gt;Ivars Peterson, ''The Mathematical Tourist'', Freeman, 1988, {{isbn|0-7167-1953-3}}. p. 4 &quot;A few complain that the computer program can't be verified properly&quot;, (in reference to the Haken\u2013Apple proof of the Four Color Theorem).&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[proof assistant]]s allow verifying all details that cannot be given in a hand-written proof, and provide certainty of the correctness of long proofs such as that of the [[Feit\u2013Thompson theorem]].{{efn|The book containing the complete proof has more than 1,000 pages.}}\n\n[[Axiom]]s in traditional thought were &quot;self-evident truths&quot;, but that conception is problematic.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The method of 'postulating' what we want has many advantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil.&quot; [[Bertrand Russell]] (1919), ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'', New York and London, [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html p. 71.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620162751/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html |date=June 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an [[axiomatic system]]. It was the goal of [[Hilbert's program]] to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem]] every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has [[independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable]] formulas; and so a final [[axiomatization]] of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but [[set theory]] in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Suppes, ''Axiomatic Set Theory'', Dover, 1972, {{isbn|0-486-61630-4}}. p. 1, &quot;Among the many branches of modern mathematics set theory occupies a unique place: with a few rare exceptions the entities which are studied and analyzed in mathematics may be regarded as certain particular sets or classes of objects.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Fields of mathematics==\n{{see also|Areas of mathematics|Glossary of areas of mathematics}}\n[[File:Abacus 6.png|right|thumb|The [[abacus]] is a simple calculating tool used since ancient times.]]\nMathematics can, broadly speaking, be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e. [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]], and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]). In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields: to [[mathematical logic|logic]], to [[set theory]] ([[foundations of mathematics|foundations]]), to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences ([[applied mathematics]]), and more recently to the rigorous study of [[uncertainty]]. While some areas might seem unrelated, the [[Langlands program]] has found connections between areas previously thought unconnected, such as [[Galois groups]], [[Riemann surface]]s and [[number theory]].\n\n[[Discrete mathematics]] conventionally groups together the fields of mathematics which study mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous.\n\n===Foundations and philosophy===\nIn order to clarify the [[foundations of mathematics]], the fields of [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]] were developed. Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of [[logic]] and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies [[set (mathematics)|sets]] or collections of objects. The phrase &quot;crisis of foundations&quot; describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Luke Howard Hodgkin &amp; Luke Hodgkin, ''A History of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to the present day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time, including the [[controversy over Cantor's theory|controversy over Cantor's set theory]] and the [[Brouwer\u2013Hilbert controversy]].\n\nMathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous [[axiom]]atic framework, and studying the implications of such a framework. As such, it is home to [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]] which (informally) imply that any effective [[formal system]] that contains basic arithmetic, if ''sound'' (meaning that all theorems that can be proved are true), is necessarily ''incomplete'' (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved ''in that system''). Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation, G\u00f6del showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical fact, but which does not follow from those axioms. Therefore, no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory. Modern logic is divided into [[recursion theory]], [[model theory]], and [[proof theory]], and is closely linked to [[theoretical computer science]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} as well as to [[category theory]]. In the context of recursion theory, the impossibility of a full axiomatization of number theory can also be formally demonstrated as a [[MRDP theorem#Further applications|consequence of the MRDP theorem]].\n\n[[Theoretical computer science]] includes [[computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], [[computational complexity theory]], and [[information theory]]. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most well-known model\u2014the [[Turing machine]]. Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware. A famous problem is the &quot;[[P = NP problem|{{nowrap|'''P''' {{=}} '''NP'''?}}]]&quot; problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070811193730/http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute], P=NP, claymath.org&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as [[data compression|compression]] and [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].\n\n:{|style=&quot;border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto&quot; cellspacing=&quot;15&quot;\n|&lt;math&gt;p \\Rightarrow q &lt;/math&gt;|| [[File:Venn A intersect B.svg|128px]] || [[File:Commutative diagram for morphism.svg|96px]] || [[File:DFAexample.svg|96px]]\n|-\n|[[Mathematical logic]] || [[Set theory]] || [[Category theory]] || [[Theory of computation]]\n|}\n\n===Pure mathematics===\n{{main|Pure mathematics}}\n\n====Quantity====\n{{Main|Arithmetic}}\n&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;\nThe study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar [[natural number]]s and [[integer]]s (&quot;whole numbers&quot;) and arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in [[arithmetic]]. The deeper properties of integers are studied in [[number theory]], from which come such popular results as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. The [[twin prime]] conjecture and [[Goldbach's conjecture]] are two unsolved problems in number theory.\n\nAs the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a [[subset]] of the [[rational number]]s (&quot;[[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]&quot;). These, in turn, are contained within the [[real number]]s, which are used to represent [[Continuous function|continuous]] quantities. Real numbers are generalized to [[complex number]]s. These are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the [[transfinite number]]s, which formalize the concept of &quot;[[infinity]]&quot;. According to the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] all solutions of equations in one unknown with complex coefficients are complex numbers, regardless of degree. Another area of study is the size of sets, which is described with the [[cardinal number]]s. These include the [[aleph number]]s, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.\n\n:{|style=&quot;border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto&quot; cellspacing=&quot;20&quot;\n|&lt;math&gt;(0), 1, 2, 3,\\ldots&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\\ldots,-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\,\\ldots&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; -2, \\frac{2}{3}, 1.21&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;-e, \\sqrt{2}, 3, \\pi&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;2, i, -2+3i, 2e^{i\\frac{4\\pi}{3}}&lt;/math&gt; ||&lt;math&gt;\\aleph_0, \\aleph_1, \\aleph_2, \\ldots, \\aleph_{\\alpha}, \\ldots.\\ &lt;/math&gt;\n|-\n|[[Natural number]]s|| [[Integer]]s || [[Rational number]]s || [[Real number]]s || [[Complex number]]s || [[Infinite cardinal]]s\n|}\n\n====Structure====\n{{Main|Algebra}}\n&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;\nMany mathematical objects, such as [[set (mathematics)|sets]] of numbers and [[function (mathematics)|functions]], exhibit internal structure as a consequence of [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance [[number theory]] studies properties of the set of [[integer]]s that can be expressed in terms of [[arithmetic]] operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or [[mathematical structure|structures]]) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of [[abstraction]], to state [[axiom]]s for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of [[abstract algebra]].\n\nBy its great generality, abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning [[compass and straightedge constructions]] were finally solved using [[Galois theory]], which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic theory is [[linear algebra]], which is the general study of [[vector space]]s, whose elements called [[vector (geometric)|vectors]] have both quantity and direction, and can be used to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of [[geometry]] and [[algebra]] have very strong interactions in modern mathematics. [[Combinatorics]] studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.\n\n:{|style=&quot;border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto&quot; cellspacing=&quot;15&quot;\n|&lt;math&gt;\\begin{matrix} (1,2,3) &amp; (1,3,2) \\\\ (2,1,3) &amp; (2,3,1) \\\\ (3,1,2) &amp; (3,2,1) \\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; || [[File:Elliptic curve simple.svg|96px]] || [[File:Rubik's cube.svg|96px]] || [[File:Group diagdram D6.svg|96px]] || [[File:Lattice of the divisibility of 60.svg|96px]] || [[File:Braid-modular-group-cover.svg|96px]]\n|-\n|[[Combinatorics]] || [[Number theory]] || [[Group theory]] || [[Graph theory]] || [[Order theory]] || [[Algebra]]\n|}\n\n====Space====\n{{Main|Geometry}}\n&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;\nThe study of space originates with [[geometry]]\u2014in particular, [[Euclidean geometry]], which combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known [[Pythagorean theorem]]. [[Trigonometry]] is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions. The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, [[non-Euclidean geometries]] (which play a central role in [[general relativity]]) and [[topology]]. Quantity and space both play a role in [[analytic geometry]], [[differential geometry]], and [[algebraic geometry]]. [[Convex geometry|Convex]] and [[discrete geometry]] were developed to solve problems in [[geometry of numbers|number theory]] and [[functional analysis]] but now are pursued with an eye on applications in [[convex optimization|optimization]] and [[computational geometry|computer science]]. Within differential geometry are the concepts of [[fiber bundles]] and calculus on [[manifold]]s, in particular, [[vector calculus|vector]] and [[tensor calculus]]. Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of [[polynomial]] equations, combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of [[topological groups]], which combine structure and space. [[Lie group]]s are used to study space, structure, and change. [[Topology]] in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in 20th-century mathematics; it includes [[point-set topology]], [[set-theoretic topology]], [[algebraic topology]] and [[differential topology]]. In particular, instances of modern-day topology are [[metrizability theory]], [[axiomatic set theory]], [[homotopy theory]], and [[Morse theory]]. Topology also includes the now solved [[Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]], and the still unsolved areas of the [[Hodge conjecture]]. Other results in geometry and topology, including the [[four color theorem]] and [[Kepler conjecture]], have been proven only with the help of computers.\n\n:{|style=&quot;border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto&quot; cellspacing=&quot;15&quot;\n|[[File:Illustration to Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean theorem.svg|96px]] || [[File:Sinusv\u00e5g 400px.png|96px]] || [[File:Hyperbolic triangle.svg|96px]] || [[File:Torus.svg|96px]] || [[File:Mandel zoom 07 satellite.jpg|96px]] || [[File:Measure illustration (Vector).svg|70px]]\n|-\n|[[Geometry]] || [[Trigonometry]] || [[Differential geometry]] || [[Topology]] || [[Fractal|Fractal geometry]] || [[Measure theory]]\n|}\n\n====Change====\n{{Main|Calculus}}\n&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;\nUnderstanding and describing change is a common theme in the [[natural science]]s, and [[calculus]] was developed as a tool to investigate it. [[Function (mathematics)|Functions]] arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of [[real number]]s and functions of a real variable is known as [[real analysis]], with [[complex analysis]] the equivalent field for the [[complex number]]s. [[Functional analysis]] focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) [[Space#Mathematics|spaces]] of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is [[quantum mechanics]]. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as [[differential equation]]s. Many phenomena in nature can be described by [[dynamical system]]s; [[chaos theory]] makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] behavior.\n\n{|style=&quot;border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto&quot; cellspacing=&quot;20&quot;\n|-\n|[[File:Integral as region under curve.svg|96px]] || [[File:Vector field.svg|96px]] || [[File:Navier Stokes Laminar.svg|96px]] || [[File:Limitcycle.svg|96px]] || [[File:Lorenz attractor.svg|96px]] || [[File:Conformal grid after M\u00f6bius transformation.svg|96px]]\n|-\n|[[Calculus]] || [[Vector calculus]]|| [[Differential equation]]s || [[Dynamical system]]s || [[Chaos theory]] || [[Complex analysis]]\n|}\n\n===Applied mathematics===\n{{Main|Applied mathematics}}\n[[Applied mathematics]] concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in [[science]], [[engineering]], [[business]], and [[Industry (manufacturing)|industry]]. Thus, &quot;applied mathematics&quot; is a [[mathematical science]] with specialized [[knowledge]]. The term ''applied mathematics'' also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, ''applied mathematics'' focuses on the &quot;formulation, study, and use of mathematical models&quot; in science, engineering, and other areas of mathematical practice.\n\nIn the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in [[pure mathematics]].\n\n====Statistics and other decision sciences====\n{{Main|Statistics}}\nApplied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of statistics, whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with [[probability theory]]. Statisticians (working as part of a research project) &quot;create data that makes sense&quot; with [[random sampling]] and with randomized [[design of experiments|experiments]];&lt;ref&gt;[[C.R. Rao|Rao, C.R.]] (1997) ''Statistics and Truth: Putting Chance to Work'', World Scientific. {{isbn|981-02-3111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the design of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before the data becomes available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or when analyzing data from [[observational study|observational studies]], statisticians &quot;make sense of the data&quot; using the art of [[statistical model|modelling]] and the theory of [[statistical inference|inference]]\u2014with [[model selection]] and [[estimation theory|estimation]]; the estimated models and consequential [[Scientific method#Predictions from the hypothesis|predictions]] should be [[statistical hypothesis testing|tested]] on [[Scientific method#Evaluation and improvement|new data]].{{efn|Like other mathematical sciences such as [[physics]] and [[computer science]], statistics is an autonomous discipline rather than a branch of applied mathematics. Like research physicists and computer scientists, research statisticians are mathematical scientists. Many statisticians have a degree in mathematics, and some statisticians are also mathematicians.}}\n\n[[Statistical theory]] studies [[statistical decision theory|decision problems]] such as minimizing the [[risk]] ([[expected loss]]) of a statistical action, such as using a [[statistical method|procedure]] in, for example, [[parameter estimation]], [[hypothesis testing]], and [[selection algorithm|selecting the best]]. In these traditional areas of [[mathematical statistics]], a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an [[objective function]], like expected loss or [[cost]], under specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;RaoOpt&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Arthanari |editor1-first=T.S. |editor2-last=Dodge |editor2-first=Yadolah |editor2-link=Yadolah Dodge |last=Rao |first=C.R. |authorlink=C.R.

[[Numerical analysis]] studies methods for problems in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]] using [[functional analysis]] and [[approximation theory]]; numerical analysis includes the study of [[approximation]] and [[discretization|discretisation]] broadly with special concern for [[rounding error]]s. Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially [[algorithm]]ic [[numerical linear algebra|matrix]] and [[graph theory]].

The Fields Medal is often considered a mathematical equivalent to the Nobel Prize.\n\nThe [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]], instituted in 1978, recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the [[Abel Prize]], was instituted in 2003. The [[Chern Medal]] was introduced in 2010 to recognize lifetime achievement. These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular body of work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an outstanding problem in an established field.\n\nA famous list of 23 [[open problem]]s, called &quot;[[Hilbert's problems]]&quot;, was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]]. This list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the &quot;[[Millennium Prize Problems]]&quot;, was published in 2000. Only one of them, the [[Riemann hypothesis]], duplicates one of Hilbert's problems. A solution to any of these problems carries a 1 million dollar reward. Currently, only one of these problems, the [[Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture]], has been solved.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]\n* [[Lists of mathematics topics]]\n* [[Mathematical sciences]]\n* [[Mathematics and art]]\n* [[Mathematics education]]\n* [[National Museum of Mathematics]]\n* [[Philosophy of mathematics]]\n* [[Relationship between mathematics and physics]]\n* [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em\n|refs=\n&lt;ref name=future&gt;[[Lynn Steen|Steen, L.A.]] (April 29, 1988).

General [[definitions of music]] include common elements such as [[pitch (music)|pitch]] (which governs [[melody]] and [[harmony]]), [[rhythm]] (and its associated concepts [[tempo]], [[meter (music)|meter]], and [[articulation (music)|articulation]]), [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of [[timbre]] and [[texture (music)|texture]] (which are sometimes termed the &quot;color&quot; of a musical sound). Different [[Music genre|styles or types]] of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of [[musical instrument|instruments]] and vocal techniques ranging from [[singing]] to [[rapping]]; there are solely [[Instrumental music|instrumental pieces]], [[a capella|solely vocal pieces]] (such as songs without instrumental [[accompaniment]]) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae#Ancient Greek|\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae]] (''mousike''; &quot;art of the [[Muses]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;perseus.tufts.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368891 |title=Mousike, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek\u2013English Lexicon'', at Perseus |publisher=perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;\nSee [[glossary of musical terminology]].\n\nIn its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or [[Culture|cultural]] activity include the creation of works of music ([[song]]s, tunes, [[symphony|symphonies]], and so on), the [[Music criticism|criticism of music]], the [[Musicology|study of the history of music]], and the [[Aesthetics of music|aesthetic examination of music]]. [[Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient philosophy#Ancient Indian philosophers|Indian philosophers]] defined music in two parts: melodies, as tones ordered horizontally, and harmonies as tones ordered vertically. Common sayings such as &quot;the [[harmony of the spheres]]&quot; and &quot;it is music to my ears&quot; point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer [[John Cage]] thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, &quot;There is no [[noise]], only sound.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DB1E3BF930A2575BC0A964958260 |title=John Cage, 79, a Minimalist Enchanted With Sound, Dies |last=Kozinn |first=Allen |authorlink=Allan Kozinn |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 August 1992 |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as &quot;not being music&quot;, including [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Grosse Fuge]]'' [[string quartet]] in 1825,&lt;ref&gt;Watson 2009, 109\u201310.{{incomplete short citation|date=July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; early [[jazz]] in the beginning of the 1900s&lt;ref&gt;Reiland Rabaka.

Oxford University Press, 2015. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many types of music, including [[popular music]], [[traditional music]], [[art music]], [[Liturgical music|music written for religious ceremonies]] and [[work song]]s such as [[chantey]]s. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions\u2014such as Classical music symphonies from the 1700s and 1800s\u2014through to spontaneously played [[Musical improvisation|improvisational music]] such as [[jazz]], and [[avant-garde]] styles of [[aleatory|chance-based]] [[contemporary music]] from the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nMusic can be divided into [[music genre|genres]] (e.g., [[country music]]) and genres can be further divided into [[subgenre]]s (e.g., [[country blues]] and [[pop country]] are two of the many country subgenres), although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and occasionally controversial. For example, it can be hard to draw the line between some early 1980s [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Within [[the arts]], music may be classified as a [[performing arts|performing art]], a fine art or as an auditory art. Music may be played or sung and heard live at a [[rock concert]] or orchestra performance, heard live as part of a [[theatre music|dramatic work]] (a [[music theater]] show or opera), or it may be recorded and listened to on a radio, MP3 player, [[CD player]], [[smartphone]] or as [[film score]] or TV show.\n\nIn many cultures, music is an important part of people's way of life, as it plays a key role in  [[religious ritual]]s, [[rite of passage]] ceremonies (e.g., graduation and marriage), social activities (e.g., [[dance club|dancing]]) and cultural activities ranging from amateur [[karaoke]] singing to playing in an amateur [[Funk|funk band]] or singing in a community [[choir]]. People may make music as a hobby, like a teen playing cello in a [[youth orchestra]], or work as a professional musician or singer. The [[music industry]] includes the individuals who create new songs and musical pieces (such as songwriters and composers), individuals who perform music (which include orchestra, [[jazz]] band and rock band musicians, singers and conductors), individuals who record music (music producers and [[sound engineer]]s), individuals who organize concert tours, and individuals who sell recordings, [[sheet music]], and scores to customers. Even once a song or piece has been performed, [[music criticism|music critics]], [[music journalism|music journalists]], and [[musicology|music scholars]] may assess and evaluate the piece and its performance.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Muses sarcophagus Louvre MR880.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|In [[Greek mythology]], the nine [[Muse]]s were the inspiration for many creative endeavors, including [[the arts]].]]\nThe word, 'music' is derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae#Ancient Greek|\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae]] (''mousike''; &quot;art of the [[Muses]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;perseus.tufts.edu&quot;/&gt; In [[Greek mythology]], the nine [[Muse]]s were the goddesses who inspired literature, science, and [[the arts]] and who were the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, song-lyrics, and myths in the Greek culture. According to the ''Online Etymological Dictionary'', the term &quot;music&quot; is derived from &quot;mid-13c., musike, from [[Old French]] ''musique'' (12c.) and directly from [[Latin]] ''musica'' &quot;the art of music,&quot; also including poetry (also [the] source of Spanish ''m\u00fasica'', Italian ''musica'', [[Old High German]] ''mosica'', German ''Musik'', Dutch ''muziek'', Danish ''musik'').&quot; This is derived from the &quot;...Greek ''mousike (techne)'' &quot;(art) of the Muses,&quot; from fem. of mousikos &quot;pertaining to the Muses,&quot; from Mousa &quot;Muse&quot; (see muse (n.)). Modern spelling [dates] from [the] 1630s. In [[classical Greece]], [the term &quot;music&quot; refers to] any art in which the Muses presided, but especially music and [[lyric poetry]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;etymonline&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=music |title=music |publisher=Douglas Harper |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==As a form of art or entertainment==\n[[File:Photo r\u00e9cital 028.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|{{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Gabriel Ferlan|fr}} performing at a 2008 concert at the coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Saint-Fran\u00e7ois Xavier]]\nMusic is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. When music was only available through [[sheet music]] scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras, music lovers would buy the [[sheet music]] of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on the piano. With the advent of the [[phonograph]], records of popular songs, rather than sheet music became the dominant way that music lovers would enjoy their favourite songs. With the advent of home [[tape recorder]]s in the 1980s and [[digital music]] in the 1990s, music lovers could make tapes or [[playlist]]s of their favourite songs and take them with them on a [[Cassette player|portable cassette player]] or MP3 player. Some music lovers create [[mix tape]]s of their favourite songs, which serve as a &quot;self-portrait, a gesture of friendship, prescription for an ideal party... [and] an environment consisting solely of what is most ardently loved.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kirszner, Laurie G. (January 2012). ''Patterns for College Writing''. Bedford/St. Martin's. p. 520. {{ISBN|978-0-312-67684-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAmateur musicians can compose or perform music for their own pleasure, and derive their income elsewhere. [[Professional musician]]s are employed by a range of institutions and organisations, including armed forces (in [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s and popular music groups), churches and synagogues, symphony orchestras, broadcasting or [[filmmaking|film production]] companies, and [[music school]]s. Professional musicians sometimes work as freelancers or [[session musician]]s, seeking contracts and engagements in a variety of settings. There are often many links between amateur and professional musicians. Beginning amateur musicians take [[music lesson|lessons]] with professional musicians. In community settings, advanced amateur musicians perform with professional musicians in a variety of ensembles such as community [[concert band]]s and community orchestras.\n\nA distinction is often made between music performed for a live audience and music that is performed in a studio so that it can be recorded and distributed through the music retail system or the broadcasting system. However, there are also many cases where a live performance in front of an audience is also recorded and distributed. Live concert recordings are popular in both classical music and in [[popular music]] forms such as rock, where [[Bootleg recording|illegally taped live concerts]] are prized by music lovers. In the [[jam band]] scene, live, improvised [[jam session]]s are preferred to studio recordings.\n\n===Composition===\n{{Main|Musical composition}}\n[[File:Coffee and synths. KayoDot album &quot;Hubardo&quot; recording, 2013-06-13.jpg|thumb|People composing music in 2013 using [[electronic keyboard]]s and computers.]]\n[[File:Michel Richard Delalande engraving BNF Gallica.jpg|thumb|French [[Baroque music]] composer [[Michel Richard Delalande]] (1657\u20131726), pen in hand.]]\n&quot;Composition&quot; is the act or practice of creating a song, an [[instrumental music]] piece, a work with both singing and instruments, or another type of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing also includes the creation of [[music notation]], such as a [[sheet music|sheet music &quot;score&quot;]], which is then performed by the composer or by other singers or musicians. In popular music and traditional music, the act of composing, which is typically called songwriting, may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the [[lead sheet]], which sets out the [[melody]], [[lyrics]] and [[chord progression]]. In classical music, the composer typically [[orchestration|orchestrates]] his or her own compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music.\n\nEven when music is notated relatively precisely, as in classical music, there are many decisions that a performer has to make, because notation does not specify all of the elements of music precisely. The process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed &quot;interpretation&quot;. Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or [[musical phrasing|phrasing]] of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting their songs, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as [[Historically informed performance|performance practice]], whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAlthough a musical composition often uses [[musical notation]] and has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in [[popular music]] when a band collaborates to write a song, or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics, and a third person orchestrates the songs. In some styles of music, such as the [[blues]], a composer/songwriter may create, perform and record new songs or pieces without ever writing them down in music notation. A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from avant-garde music that uses [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]], to text compositions such as ''[[Aus den sieben Tagen]]'', to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called [[aleatoric music]], and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], and [[Witold Lutos\u0142awski]]. A more commonly known example of chance-based music is the sound of [[wind chimes]] jingling in a breeze.\n\nThe study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough to include the creation of [[popular music]] and [[traditional music]] songs and instrumental pieces as well as spontaneously [[Music improvisation|improvised]] works like those of [[free jazz]] performers and African percussionists such as [[Ewe drumming|Ewe drummers]].\n\n===Notation===\n{{Main|Musical notation}}\n[[File:Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Sheet music is a written representation of music. [[Homorhythm]]ic (i.e., [[hymn]]-style) arrangement of the traditional &quot;[[Adeste Fideles]]&quot; in standard two-staff format for mixed voices.[[File:Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.mid|thumb|left]]]]\nIn the 2000s, music notation typically means the written expression of music notes and rhythms on paper using symbols. When music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of the music, such as the notes of a [[melody]], are notated. Music notation also often provides instructions on how to perform the music. For example, the sheet music for a song may state that the song is a &quot;slow blues&quot; or a &quot;fast swing&quot;, which indicates the tempo and the genre.  To read music notation, a person must have an understanding of [[music theory]], [[harmony]] and the [[performance practice]] associated with a particular song or piece's genre.\n\nWritten notation varies with style and period of music. In the 2000s, notated music is produced as [[sheet music]] or, for individuals with computer [[scorewriter]] programs, as an image on a [[computer screen]]. In ancient times, music notation was put onto stone or clay tablets. To perform music from notation, a singer or instrumentalist requires an understanding of the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or a genre. In genres requiring [[musical improvisation]], the performer often plays from music where only the [[Chord progression|chord changes]] and form of the song are written, requiring the performer to have a great understanding of the music's structure, harmony and the styles of a particular genre (e.g., [[jazz]] or [[country music]]).\n\nIn Western art music, the most common types of written notation are scores, which include all the music parts of an ensemble piece, and parts, which are the music notation for the individual performers or singers. In popular music, jazz, and blues, the standard musical notation is the [[lead sheet]], which notates the melody, chords, [[lyrics]] (if it is a vocal piece), and structure of the music. [[Fake book]]s are also used in jazz; they may consist of lead sheets or simply chord charts, which permit [[rhythm section]] members to improvise an [[accompaniment]] part to jazz songs. Scores and parts are also used in popular music and jazz, particularly in large ensembles such as jazz &quot;[[big band]]s.&quot; In popular music, guitarists and electric bass players often read music notated in [[tablature]] (often abbreviated as &quot;tab&quot;), which indicates the location of the notes to be played on the instrument using a diagram of the guitar or bass fingerboard. Tablature was also used in the Baroque era to notate music for the [[lute]], a stringed, fretted instrument.\n\n===Improvisation===\n[[File:Johnny Hodges edit.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Improvisation plays a central role in jazz; musicians learn progressions using scale and chord tones (Pictured is [[Johnny Hodges]])]]\n{{Main|Musical improvisation}}\n[[Musical improvisation]] is the creation of spontaneous music, often within (or based on) a pre-existing harmonic framework or [[chord progression]]. Improvisers use the notes of the chord, various scales that are associated with each chord, and chromatic ornaments and passing tones which may be neither chord tones not from the typical scales associated with a chord. Musical improvisation can be done with or without preparation. Improvisation is a major part of some types of music, such as [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[jazz fusion]], in which instrumental performers improvise solos, melody lines and accompaniment parts. \n\nIn the Western art music tradition, improvisation was an important skill during the Baroque era and during the Classical era. In the Baroque era, performers improvised ornaments, and [[basso continuo]] keyboard players improvised [[chord voicing]]s based on [[figured bass]] notation. As well, the top soloists were expected to be able to improvise pieces such as [[Prelude (music)|prelude]]s. In the Classical era, solo performers and singers improvised virtuoso [[cadenza]]s during concerts.\n\nHowever, in the 20th and early 21st century, as &quot;common practice&quot; Western [[art music]] performance became institutionalized in symphony orchestras, opera houses and ballets, improvisation has played a smaller role, as more and more music was notated in scores and parts for musicians to play. At the same time, some 20th and 21st century [[art music]] composers have increasingly included improvisation in their creative work. In [[Indian classical music]], improvisation is a core component and an essential criterion of performances.\n\n===Theory===\n{{Main|Music theory}}\nMusic theory encompasses the nature and mechanics of music. It often involves identifying patterns that govern composers' techniques and examining the [[language]] and [[Musical notation|notation]] of music. In a grand sense, music theory distills and analyzes the [[parameter (music)|parameters]] or elements of music \u2013 rhythm, [[harmony]] ([[Diatonic function|harmonic function]]), [[melody]], structure, [[Musical form|form]], and [[Texture (music)|texture]]. Broadly, music theory may include any statement, belief, or conception of or about music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boretz |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Boretz |title=Meta-Variations: studies in the foundations of musical thought\u2026 |publisher=Open Space |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who study these properties are known as music theorists, and they typically work as professors in colleges, universities, and music conservatories. Some have applied [[acoustics]], [[human physiology]], and [[psychology]] to the explanation of how and why music is [[perceive]]d. Music theorists publish their research in music theory journals and university press books.\n\n==Elements==\n{{main|Elements of music}}\nMusic has many different fundamentals or elements. Depending on the definition of &quot;element&quot; being used, these can include: pitch, beat or pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation of voices, timbre or color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form and structure. The elements of music feature prominently in the music curriculums of Australia, UK and US. All three curriculums identify pitch, dynamics, timbre and texture as elements, but the other identified elements of music are far from universally agreed. Below is a list of the three official versions of the &quot;elements of music&quot;:\n* Australia: pitch, timbre, texture, dynamics and expression, rhythm, form and structure.&lt;ref&gt;ACARA.

The inter-related dimensions of music are listed as: pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure and appropriate musical notations.&lt;ref&gt;Gov.uk. (2013).

The two most common contexts can be differentiated by describing them as the &quot;rudimentary elements of music&quot; and the &quot;perceptual elements of music&quot;.\n\n===Rudimentary elements===\nIn the 1800s, the phrases &quot;the elements of music&quot; and &quot;the rudiments of music&quot; were used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;[[Muzio Clementi|Clementi, M.]]: &quot;Introduction to the art of playing on the piano forte&quot;, Da Capo Press (1974).

In Dictionary.com unabridged. Retrieved 10 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's curriculum switch to the &quot;inter-related dimensions of music&quot; seems to be a move back to using the rudimentary elements of music.\n\n===Perceptual elements===\nSince the emergence of the study of [[psychoacoustics]] in the 1930s, most lists of elements of music have related more to how we ''hear'' music than how we learn to play it or study it. C.E. Seashore, in his book ''Psychology of Music'',&lt;ref&gt;Seashore, C. E. (1938). ''Psychology of Music'': New York: Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; identified four &quot;psychological attributes of sound&quot;. These were: &quot;pitch, loudness, time, and timbre&quot; (p.&amp;nbsp;3). He did not call them the &quot;elements of music&quot; but referred to them as &quot;elemental components&quot; (p.&amp;nbsp;2). Nonetheless these elemental components link precisely with four of the most common musical elements: &quot;Pitch&quot; and &quot;timbre&quot; match exactly, &quot;loudness&quot; links with dynamics and &quot;time&quot; links with the time-based elements of rhythm, duration and tempo. This usage of the phrase &quot;the elements of music&quot; links more closely with ''Webster's New 20th Century Dictionary'' definition of an element as: &quot;a substance which cannot be divided into a simpler form by known methods&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Webster, N. (Ed.) (1947) Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary. Clevelend Ohio: The World Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; and educational institutions' lists of elements generally align with this definition as well.\n\nAlthough writers of lists of &quot;rudimentary elements of music&quot; can vary their lists depending on their personal (or institutional) priorities, the perceptual elements of music should consist of an established (or proven) list of discrete elements which can be independently manipulated to achieve an intended musical effect. It seems at this stage that there is still research to be done in this area. \n\nA slightly different way of approaching the identification of the elements of music, is to identify the &quot;elements of [[sound]]&quot; as:  [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[Duration (music)|duration]], [[loudness]], [[timbre]], [[Texture (music)|sonic texture]] and  [[Sound localization|spatial location]],&lt;ref&gt;Burton, R.L.

Paper presented at: Music: Educating for life: ASME XXth National Conference (pp. 22\u201328), Parkville, Victoria: The Australian Society for Music Education Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Description of elements===\n\n====Pitch and melody====\n[[Pitch (music)|Pitch]] is an aspect of a sound that we can hear, reflecting whether one musical sound, note or tone is &quot;higher&quot; or &quot;lower&quot; than another musical sound, note or tone. We can talk about the highness or lowness of pitch in the more general sense, such as the way a listener hears a piercingly high [[piccolo]] note or [[whistling]] tone as higher in pitch than a deep thump of a [[bass drum]]. We also talk about pitch in the precise sense associated with musical [[melody|melodies]], [[bassline]]s and [[chord (music)|chords]]. Precise pitch can only be determined in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise. For example, it is much easier for listeners to discern the pitch of a single note played on a piano  than to try to discern the pitch of a [[crash cymbal]] that is struck.\n[[File:Popgoesweasel.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|The melody to the traditional song &quot;[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]&quot;  [[File:Pop Goes the Weasel.ogg|thumb]]]]\n\nA [[melody]] (also called a &quot;tune&quot;) is a series of pitches (notes) sounding in succession (one after the other), often in a rising and falling pattern. The notes of a melody are typically created using pitch systems such as [[Musical scale|scales]] or [[Musical mode|modes]]. Melodies also often contain notes from the chords used in the song. The melodies in simple folk songs and traditional songs may use only the notes of a single scale, the scale associated with the tonic note or [[key (music)|key]] of a given song. For example, a folk song in the key of C (also referred to as C major) may have a melody that uses only the notes of the C major scale (the individual notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B and C; these are the &quot;[[white notes]]&quot; on a piano keyboard. On the other hand, [[Bebop]]-era jazz from the 1940s and [[contemporary music]] from the 20th and 21st centuries may use melodies with many [[chromatic note]]s (i.e., notes in addition to the notes of the major scale; on a piano, a chromatic scale would include all the notes on the keyboard, including the &quot;white notes&quot; and &quot;black notes&quot; and unusual scales, such as the [[whole tone scale]] (a whole tone scale in the key of C would contain the notes C, D, E, F{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}} and A{{music|sharp}}). A low, deep musical line played by bass instruments such as double bass, electric bass or [[tuba]] is called a [[bassline]].\n\n====Harmony and chords====\n[[File:Sol7 accordo chitarra G7 guitar chord.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|When musicians play three or more different [[Musical note|notes]] at the same time, this creates a [[Chord (music)|chord]]. In [[Western culture#Music|Western music]], including classical music, pop music, rock music and many related styles, the most common chords are [[triad (music)|triads]]\u2013 three notes usually played at the same time. The most commonly used chords are the [[major chord]] and the [[minor chord]]. An example of a major chord is the three pitches C, E and G. An example of a minor chord is the three pitches A, C and E. (Pictured is a [[guitar player]] performing a chord on a guitar).]]\n[[Harmony]] refers to the &quot;vertical&quot; sounds of pitches in music, which means pitches that are played or sung together at the same time to create a [[chord (music)|chord]]. Usually this means the notes are played at the same time, although harmony may also be implied by a melody that outlines a harmonic structure (i.e., by using melody notes that are played one after the other, outlining the notes of a chord). In music written using the system of major-minor [[tonality]] (&quot;keys&quot;), which includes most classical music written from 1600 to 1900 and most Western pop, rock and traditional music, the key of a piece determines the scale used, which centres around the &quot;home note&quot; or [[tonic (music)|tonic]] of the key. Simple classical pieces and many pop and traditional music songs are written so that all the music is in a single key. More complex Classical, pop and traditional music songs and pieces may have two keys (and in some cases three or more keys). Classical music from the Romantic era (written from about 1820\u20131900) often contains multiple keys, as does [[jazz]], especially [[Bebop]] jazz from the 1940s, in which the key or &quot;home note&quot; of a song may change every four bars or even every two bars.\n\n====Rhythm====\nRhythm is the arrangement of sounds and silences in time. [[Metre (music)|Meter]] animates time in regular pulse groupings, called [[Bar (music)|measures or bars]], which in Western classical, popular and traditional music often group notes in sets of two (e.g., 2/4 time), three (e.g., 3/4 time, also known as [[Waltz]] time, or 3/8 time), or four (e.g., 4/4 time). Meters are made easier to hear because songs and pieces often (but not always) place an emphasis on the first beat of each grouping. Notable exceptions exist, such as the [[backbeat]] used in much Western pop and rock, in which a song that uses a measure that consists of four beats (called 4/4 time or [[common time]]) will have accents on beats two and four, which are typically performed by the drummer on the [[snare drum]], a loud and distinctive-sounding percussion instrument. In pop and rock, the rhythm parts of a song are played by the [[rhythm section]], which includes chord-playing instruments (e.g., electric guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, or other keyboard instruments), a bass instrument (typically electric bass or for some styles such as [[jazz]] and [[bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]], double bass) and a drum kit player.\n\n====Texture====\n[[Musical texture]] is the overall sound of a piece of music or song.  The texture of a piece or song is determined by how the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic materials are combined in a composition, thus determining the overall nature of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices (see common types below). For example, a thick texture contains many 'layers' of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass. The thickness also is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments. Texture is commonly described according to the number of and relationship between [[part (music)|parts]] or lines of music:\n* [[monophony]]: a single [[melody]] (or &quot;tune&quot;) with neither instrumental [[accompaniment]] nor a [[harmony part]]. A mother singing a [[lullaby]] to her baby would be an example.\n* [[heterophony]]: two or more instruments or singers playing/singing the same melody, but with each performer slightly varying the rhythm or speed of the melody or adding different [[ornament (music)|ornaments]] to the melody. Two [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[fiddler]]s playing the same [[traditional music|traditional]] fiddle tune together will typically each vary the melody a bit and each add different ornaments.\n* [[polyphony]]: multiple independent melody lines that interweave together, which are sung or played at the same time. [[Choir|Choral]] music written in the [[Renaissance music]] era was typically written in this style. A [[round (music)|round]], which is a song such as &quot;[[Row, Row, Row Your Boat]]&quot;, which different groups of singers all start to sing at a different time, is a simple example of polyphony.\n* [[homophony]]: a clear melody supported by [[chord (music)|chordal]] [[accompaniment]]. Most Western [[popular music]] songs from the 19th century onward are written in this texture.\n\nMusic that contains a large number of independent [[Part (music)|parts]] (e.g., a double concerto accompanied by 100 orchestral instruments with many interweaving melodic lines) is generally said to have a &quot;thicker&quot; or &quot;denser&quot; texture than a work with few parts (e.g., a solo [[flute]] melody accompanied by a single cello).\n\n====Timbre or &quot;tone color&quot;====\n[[Timbre]], sometimes called &quot;color&quot; or &quot;tone color&quot; is the quality or sound of a voice or instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Harnsberger, Lindsey. &quot;Articulation.&quot; ''Essential Dictionary of Music''. Alfred Publishing Co., Inc. Los Angeles, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; Timbre is what makes a particular musical sound different from another, even when they have the same pitch and loudness. For example, a 440&amp;nbsp;Hz A note sounds different when it is played on [[oboe]], piano, violin or electric guitar. Even if different players of the same instrument play the same note, their notes might sound different due to differences in instrumental technique (e.g., different [[embouchure]]s), different types of accessories (e.g., mouthpieces for brass players, reeds for oboe and bassoon players) or strings made out of different materials for string players (e.g., [[gut string]]s versus [[steel strings]]). Even two instrumentalists playing the same note on the same instrument (one after the other) may sound different due to different ways of playing the instrument (e.g., two string players might hold the bow differently).\n\nThe physical characteristics of sound that determine the perception of timbre include the [[spectrum]], [[envelope (waves)|envelope]] and [[overtone]]s of a note or musical sound. For [[music technology (electric)|electric]] instruments developed in the 20th century, such as electric guitar, electric bass and [[electric piano]], the performer can also change the tone by adjusting [[Graphic equalizer|equalizer controls]], tone controls on the instrument, and by using [[effects unit|electronic effects units]] such as [[distortion (music)|distortion]] pedals. The tone of the electric [[Hammond organ]] is controlled by adjusting [[Hammond organ#Drawbars|drawbars]].\n\n\n====Expression====\n[[File:20110921-FSIS-RBN-6084 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Singers add expression to the melodies they sing using many methods, including changing the tone of their singing, adding [[vibrato]] to certain notes, and emphasizing important words in the lyrics.]]\nExpressive qualities are those elements in music that create change in music without changing the main pitches or substantially changing the rhythms of the melody and its accompaniment. Performers, including singers and instrumentalists, can add musical expression to a song or piece by adding [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], by adding effects such as [[vibrato]] (with voice and some instruments, such as guitar, violin, brass instruments and woodwinds), dynamics (the loudness or softness of piece or a section of it), tempo fluctuations (e.g., [[ritardando]] or [[Tempo|accelerando]], which are, respectively slowing down and speeding up the tempo), by adding pauses or [[fermata]]s on a [[cadence (music)|cadence]], and by changing the articulation of the notes (e.g., making notes more pronounced or accented, by making notes more [[legato]], which means smoothly connected, or by making notes shorter).\n\nExpression is achieved through the manipulation of pitch (such as inflection, vibrato, slides etc.), volume (dynamics, accent, tremolo etc.), duration (tempo fluctuations, rhythmic changes, changing note duration such as with legato and staccato,  etc.), timbre (e.g. changing vocal timbre from a light to a resonant voice) and sometimes even texture (e.g. doubling the bass note for a richer effect in a piano piece). Expression therefore can be seen as a manipulation of all elements in order to convey &quot;an indication of mood, spirit, character etc.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=the definition of expression |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/expression |website=Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such cannot be included as a unique perceptual element of music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burton |first1=Russell |title=The elements of music: What are they, and who cares? |journal=Educating for Life.

Introductions and codas, when they are no more than that, are frequently excluded from formal analysis. All such units may typically be eight measures long. Sectional forms include:\n\n;Strophic form: This form is defined by its &quot;unrelieved repetition&quot; (AAAA...)\n\n;Medley: [[Medley (music)|Medley]], [[Potpourri (music)|potpourri]] is the extreme opposite, that of &quot;unrelieved variation&quot;: it is simply an indefinite sequence of self-contained sections (ABCD...), sometimes with repeats (AABBCCDD...)  Examples include orchestral [[overture]]s, which are sometimes no more than a string of the best tunes of the musical theatre show or opera to come.\n\n[[File:Binary form.png|thumb|Binary form in major and minor keys.

In 18th-century Western classical music, &quot;simple binary&quot; form was often used for dances and carried with it the convention that the two sections should be in different [[musical key]]s but same rhythm, duration and tone. The alternation of two tunes gives enough variety to permit a dance to be extended for as long as desired.\n\n;Ternary form: This form has three parts. In Western classical music a simple ternary form has a third section that is a recapitulation of the first (ABA). Often, the first section is repeated (AABA). This approach was popular in the 18th-century operatic [[aria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schulenberg|first=David|date=March 2011|title=Modifying the da capo?

Later, it gave rise to the [[thirty-two-bar form|32-bar song]], with the B section then often referred to as the &quot;[[middle eight]]&quot;. A song has more need than a dance of a self-contained form with a beginning and an end of course.\n\n;Rondo form: This form has a recurring theme alternating with different (usually contrasting) sections called &quot;episodes&quot;. It may be asymmetrical (ABACADAEA) or symmetrical (ABACABA). A recurring section, especially the main theme, is sometimes more thoroughly varied, or else one episode may be a &quot;development&quot; of it. A similar arrangement is the [[ritornello]] form of the Baroque [[concerto grosso]]. [[Arch form]] (ABCBA) resembles a symmetrical rondo without intermediate repetitions of the main theme. It is normally used in a round.\n\n;Variational form: [[Theme and Variations]]: a [[theme (music)|theme]], which in itself can be of any shorter form (binary, ternary, etc.), forms the only &quot;section&quot; and is repeated indefinitely (as in strophic form) but is varied each time (A, B, A, F, Z, A), so as to make a sort of sectional chain form. An important variant of this, much used in 17th-century British music and in the [[Passacaglia]] and [[Chaconne]], was that of the [[ground bass]] \u2013 a repeating bass theme or ''basso [[ostinato]]'' over and around which the rest of the structure unfolds, often, but not always, spinning [[polyphony|polyphonic]] or [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] threads, or improvising [[division (music)|divisions]] and [[descant]]s. This is said by Scholes (1977) to be the form ''par excellence'' of unaccompanied or accompanied solo instrumental music. The [[Rondo]] is often found with sections varied (AA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;BA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;CA&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;BA&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) or (ABA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;CA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A).\n\n;Developmental form: Developmental forms are built directly from smaller units, such as [[motif (music)|motifs]]. A well-known Classical piece with a motif is [[Beethoven's fifth symphony]], which starts with three short repeated notes and then a long note. In Classical pieces that are based on motifs, the motif is usually combined, varied and worked out in different ways, perhaps having a symmetrical or arch-like underpinning and a progressive development from beginning to end. By far the most important developmental form in Western classical music is [[sonata form]].{{pb}}This form, also known as first movement form, compound binary, or ternary form, developed from the binary-formed dance movement described above but is almost always cast in a greater ternary form having the nominal subdivisions of [[Exposition (music)|exposition]], [[Musical development|development]] and [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]]. Usually, but not always, the &quot;A&quot; parts (exposition and recapitulation, respectively) may be subdivided into two or three [[theme (music)|themes]] or theme groups which are taken asunder and recombined to form the &quot;B&quot; part (the development) \u2013 thus, e.g. (AabB[dev. of a or b]A&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;ab&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+coda). This developmental form is generally confined to certain sections of the piece, as to the middle section of the first movement of a sonata, though 19th-century composers such as [[Berlioz]], [[Liszt]] and [[Wagner]] made valiant efforts to derive large-scale works purely or mainly from the motif.\n\n===Analysis of styles===\n[[File:George Clinton 2006.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. Pictured are the influential funk musicians [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] in 2006.]]\nSome styles of music place an emphasis on certain of these fundamentals, while others place less emphasis on certain elements. To give one example, while [[Bebop]]-era [[jazz]] makes use of very complex chords, including [[altered dominant]]s and challenging [[chord progression]]s, with chords changing two or more times per bar and keys changing several times in a tune, [[funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. While Romantic era classical music from the mid- to late-1800s makes great use of dramatic changes of dynamics, from whispering pianissimo sections to thunderous fortissimo sections, some entire Baroque dance suites for [[harpsichord]] from the early 1700s may use a single dynamic. To give another example, while some [[art music]] pieces, such as [[symphony|symphonies]] are very long, some pop songs are just a few minutes long.\n==History==\n{{Main|History of music}}\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Fl\u00fbte pal\u00e9olithique (mus\u00e9e national de Slov\u00e9nie, Ljubljana) (9420310527).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.45|A bone flute which is over 41,000 years old.]]\n\n[[Prehistoric music]] can only be theorized based on findings from [[paleolithic]] archaeology sites.

[[Musical notation]] was used since Ancient times in [[Ancient Greece|Greek culture]], but in the Middle Ages, notation was first introduced by the [[Catholic church]] so that the chant melodies could be written down, to facilitate the use of the same melodies for religious music across the entire Catholic empire. The only European Medieval repertory that has been found in written form from before 800 is the [[monophony|monophonic]] [[Liturgy|liturgical]] [[plainsong]] chant of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called [[Gregorian chant]].&lt;!--+Add refs to others, e.g. Gallican, Mozarabic, &amp;c.?--&gt; Alongside these traditions of [[Religious music|sacred]] and [[church music]] there existed a vibrant tradition of [[Secular music|secular song]] (non-religious songs).

Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was hand-copied). The increased availability of sheet music helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. Musicians and singers often worked for the church, courts and towns. Church choirs grew in size, and the church remained an important patron of music. By the middle of the 15th century, composers wrote richly polyphonic sacred music, in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously. Prominent composers from this era include [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Thomas Morley]], and [[Orlande de Lassus]]. As musical activity shifted from the church to the aristocratic courts, kings, queens and princes competed for the finest composers. Many leading important composers came from the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France. They are called the Franco-Flemish composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany, England, and Spain.\n\n===Baroque===\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:right; float:left; margin-right:50px;&quot;\n|-\n! align=center |[[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S.

Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era). German Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as for [[choir]]s and keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the concerto.&lt;ref name=&quot;sdsu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |title=''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D |publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Important composers from the Baroque era include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (''[[Bach cello suites|Cello suites]]''), [[George Frideric Handel]] (''[[Handel's Messiah|Messiah]]''), [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] and [[Antonio Lucio Vivaldi]] (''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|The Four Seasons]]'').\n\n===Classicism===\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:right; float:left; margin-right:50px;&quot;\n|-\n! align=center |[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|W.A.

Even before he became a celebrated composer, he was widely known as a gifted performer and improviser.]]\nThe music of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] (1730 to 1820) aimed to imitate what were seen as the key elements of the art and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome: the ideals of balance, proportion and disciplined expression. (Note: the music from the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] should not be confused with Classical music in general, a term which refers to Western [[art music]] from the 5th century to the 2000s, which includes the Classical period as one of a number of periods).  Music from the Classical period has a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler texture than the [[Baroque music]] which preceded it. The main style was [[homophony]],&lt;ref&gt;Blume, Friedrich. Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1970. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; where a prominent [[melody]] and a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]] part are clearly distinct. Classical instrumental melodies tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were developed, and the [[fortepiano]], the forerunner to the modern piano, replaced the Baroque era [[harpsichord]] and [[pipe organ]] as the main keyboard instrument (though pipe organ continued to be used in sacred music, such as Masses).\n\nImportance was given to [[instrumental]] music. It was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the [[sonata]], the concerto, and the [[symphony]]. Others main kinds were the [[Trio (music)|trio]], [[string quartet]], [[serenade]] and [[divertimento]]. The sonata was the most important and developed form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the Classical style of sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the Classical era, from string quartets to symphonies and concertos, were based on the structure of the sonata. The instruments used [[chamber music]] and orchestra became more standardized. In place of the [[basso continuo]] group of the Baroque era, which consisted of harpsichord, organ or lute along with a number of bass instruments selected at the discretion of the group leader (e.g., viol, cello, theorbo, serpent), Classical chamber groups used specified, standardized instruments (e.g., a [[string quartet]] would be performed by two violins, a viola and a cello). The Baroque era improvised chord-playing of the continuo keyboardist or lute player was gradually phased out between 1750 and 1800.\n\nOne of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts. The aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions, but it was now possible for composers to survive without being  permanent employees of queens or princes. The increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras. The expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces. Symphonic music including symphonies, musical accompaniment to ballet and mixed vocal/instrumental genres such as opera and [[oratorio]] became more popular.\n\nThe best known composers of Classicism are [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]]. Beethoven and Schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the Classical era, as it began to move towards Romanticism.\n\n===Romanticism===\n[[File:Moritz von Schwind Schubertiade.jpg|thumb|230px|The piano was the centrepiece of social activity for middle-class urbanites in the 19th century ([[Moritz von Schwind]], 1868).

Romanticism was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature. Romantic music expanded beyond the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate, dramatic expressive pieces and songs. Romantic composers such as [[Wagner]] and [[Brahms]] attempted to increase emotional expression and power in their music to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonic [[tone poem]]s, composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music. Some composers promoted [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] pride with patriotic orchestral music inspired by [[folk music]]. The emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over tradition.\n\nRomantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the [[syncretism]] of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as literature), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. [[Romantic love]] or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the [[sonata form]] used in [[string quartet]]s and [[symphony|symphonies]]), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, new approaches were explored for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, new forms were created that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. Composers continued to develop opera and ballet music, exploring new styles and themes.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;\n\nIn the years after 1800, the music developed by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, short [[motif (music)|motifs]], developed organically, came to replace [[melody]] as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]). Later Romantic composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], and [[Gustav Mahler]] used more unusual [[chord (music)|chords]] and more [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works. During the late Romantic period, composers explored dramatic [[Chromatic (music)|chromatic]] alterations of [[tonality]], such as [[extended chord]]s and [[altered chord]]s, which created new sound &quot;colours&quot;. The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra, and the [[industrial revolution]] helped to create better instruments, creating a more powerful sound. Public concerts became an important part of well-to-do [[urban culture|urban]] society. It also saw a new diversity in [[theatre music]], including [[operetta]], and [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedy]] and other forms of musical theatre.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;\n\n===20th and 21st century music===\n{{Main|20th-century music}}\n\nIn the 19th century, one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of [[sheet music]], which middle class amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other common instruments, such as violin. With [[20th-century music]], the invention of new [[music technology (electric)|electric technologies]] such as [[radio broadcasting]] and the [[mass market]] availability of [[gramophone record]]s meant that [[sound recording]]s of songs and pieces heard by listeners (either on the radio or on their record player) became the main way to learn about new songs and pieces. There was a vast increase in music listening as the radio gained popularity and [[phonograph]]s were used to replay and distribute music, because whereas in the 19th century, the focus on sheet music restricted access to new music to the middle class and upper-class people who could read music and who owned pianos and instruments, in the 20th century, anyone with a radio or record player could hear operas, [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[big band]]s right in their own living room. This allowed lower-income people, who would never be able to afford an opera or symphony concert ticket to hear this music. It also meant that people could hear music from different parts of the country, or even different parts of the world, even if they could not afford to travel to these locations. This helped to spread musical styles.\n\nThe focus of [[art music]] in the 20th century was characterized by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. The horrors of [[World War I]] influenced many of the arts, including music, and some composers began exploring darker, harsher sounds. [[Traditional music]] styles such as [[jazz]] and [[folk music]] were used by composers as a source of ideas for classical music. [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and [[John Cage]] were all influential composers in 20th-century art music. The invention of [[sound recording]] and the ability to edit music gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the [[acousmatic]]&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, P. (1966), Trait\u00e9 des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Musique concr\u00e8te]] schools of electronic composition. Sound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed. The introduction of the [[multitrack recording]] system had a major influence on rock music, because it could do much more than record a band's performance. Using a multitrack system, a band and their music producer could overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.\n\n[[Jazz]] evolved and became an important genre of music over the course of the 20th century, and during the second half of that century, rock music did the same. Jazz is an American musical artform that originated in the beginning of the 20th century in African American communities in the Southern United States from a confluence of [[Music of Africa|African]] and European music traditions. The style's West African pedigree is evident in its use of [[blue note]]s, [[improvisation]], [[polyrhythm]]s, [[syncopation]], and the [[swung note]].&lt;ref&gt;Alyn Shipton, ''A New History of Jazz'', 2nd. ed., Continuum, 2007, pp. 4\u20135&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nRock music is a genre of [[popular music]] that developed in the 1960s from 1950s [[rock and roll]], [[rockabilly]], [[blues]], and [[country music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19838/m1/ |title=Show 55 \u2013 Crammer: A lively cram course on the history of rock and some other things|show=55}}{{Time needed|date=February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound of rock often revolves around the electric guitar or acoustic guitar, and it uses a strong [[Backbeat (music)|back beat]] laid down by a [[rhythm section]]. Along with the guitar or keyboards, saxophone and blues-style harmonica are used as soloing instruments. In its &quot;purest form&quot;, it &quot;has three chords, a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody&quot;.{{Cite quote|date=February 2020}} The traditional rhythm section for popular music is rhythm guitar, electric bass guitar, drums. Some bands also have keyboard instruments such as organ, piano, or, since the 1970s, [[analog synthesizer]]s. In the 1980s, pop musicians began using digital synthesizers, such as the [[DX-7]] synthesizer, electronic [[drum machine]]s such as the [[TR-808]] and synth bass devices (such as the [[TB-303]]) or [[synth bass]] keyboards. In the 1990s, an increasingly large range of computerized hardware musical devices and instruments and software (e.g., [[digital audio workstation]]s)  were used. In the 2020s, [[soft synth]]s and computer music apps make it possible for [[bedroom producers]] to create and record some types of music, such as [[electronic dance music]] in their own home, adding sampled and digital instruments and editing the recording digitally. In the 1990s, some bands in genres such as [[nu metal]] began including [[DJ]]s in their bands. DJs create music by manipulating recorded music on record players or CD players, using a [[DJ mixer]].\n\n==Performance==\n[[File:Naxi Musicians I.jpg|thumb|Chinese [[Nakhi|Naxi]] musicians]]\n[[File:Assyrianfolk.jpg|thumb|[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] playing ''[[zurna]]'' and ''[[Davul]]'', instruments that go back thousands of years.]]\n[[Performance]] is the physical expression of music, which occurs when a song is sung or when a piano piece, electric guitar melody, symphony, drum beat or other [[Part (music)|musical part]] is played by musicians. In classical music, a musical work is written in [[music notation]] by a composer and then it is performed once the composer is satisfied with its structure and instrumentation. However, as it gets performed, the interpretation of a song or piece can evolve and change. In classical music, instrumental performers, singers or conductors may gradually make changes to the phrasing or tempo of a piece. In popular and traditional music, the performers have a lot more freedom to make changes to the form of a song or piece. As such, in popular and traditional music styles, even when a band plays a [[cover song]], they can make changes to it such as adding a [[guitar solo]] to or inserting an introduction.\n\nA performance can either be planned out and rehearsed (practiced)\u2014which is the norm in classical music, with jazz [[big band]]s and many popular music styles\u2013or [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] over a [[chord progression]] (a sequence of chords), which is the norm in small [[jazz]] and [[blues]] groups. Rehearsals of orchestras, [[concert band]]s and [[choir]]s are led by a conductor. Rock, blues and jazz bands are usually led by the bandleader. A rehearsal is a structured repetition of a song or piece by the performers until it can be sung and/or played correctly and, if it is a song or piece for more than one musician, until the parts are together from a rhythmic and tuning perspective. Improvisation is the creation of a musical idea\u2013a melody or other musical line\u2013created on the spot, often based on scales or pre-existing melodic [[riff]]s.\n\nMany cultures have strong traditions of solo performance (in which one singer or instrumentalist performs), such as in Indian classical music, and in the Western art-music tradition. Other cultures, such as in [[Bali]], include strong traditions of group performance. All cultures include a mixture of both, and performance may range from improvised solo playing to highly planned and organised performances such as the modern classical concert, religious processions, classical music festivals or [[music competition]]s. [[Chamber music]], which is music for a small ensemble with only a few of each type of instrument, is often seen as more intimate than large symphonic works.\n\n===Oral and aural tradition===\nMany types of music, such as traditional [[blues]] and [[folk music]] were not written down in [[sheet music]]; instead, they were originally preserved in the memory of performers, and the songs were handed down [[oral history|orally]], from one musician or singer to another, or aurally, in which a performer learns a song &quot;[[Playing by ear (music)|by ear]]&quot;. When the composer of a song or piece is no longer known, this music is often classified as &quot;traditional&quot; or as a &quot;folk song&quot;. Different musical traditions have different attitudes towards how and where to make changes to the original source material, from quite strict, to those that demand improvisation or modification to the music. A culture's history and stories may also be passed on by ear through song.\n\n===Ornamentation===\n[[File:Trel 001.png|thumb|[[trill (music)|Trill]] sign\u2014a rapid alternation between two notes. [[File:Trill example ornaments.mid|thumb|left]]]]\nIn music, an [[Ornament (music)|ornament]] consists of added notes that provide decoration to a melody, bassline or other musical part. The detail included explicitly in the [[Musical notation|music notation]] varies between genres and historical periods. In general, art music notation from the 17th through the 19th centuries required performers to have a great deal of contextual knowledge about performing styles. For example, in the 17th and 18th centuries, music notated for solo performers typically indicated a simple, unadorned melody. Performers were expected to know how to add stylistically appropriate ornaments to add interest to the music, such as [[Trill (music)|trills]] and [[Turn (music)#Turn|turns]]. Different styles of music use different ornaments. A Baroque flute player might add [[mordent]]s, which are short notes that are played before the main melody note, either above or below the main melody note. A blues guitarist playing electric guitar might use string bending to add expression; a [[heavy metal guitar]] player might use [[hammer-on]]s and [[pull-off]]s.\n\nIn the 19th century, art music for solo performers may give a general instruction such as to perform the music expressively, without describing in detail how the performer should do this. The performer was expected to know how to use tempo changes, [[accent (music)|accentuation]], and [[Rest (music)|pauses]] (among other devices) to obtain this &quot;expressive&quot; performance style. In the 20th century, art music notation often became more explicit and used a range of markings and annotations to indicate to performers how they should play or sing the piece. In popular music and traditional music styles, performers are expected to know what types of ornaments are stylistically appropriate for a given song or piece, and performers typically add them in an improvised fashion. One exception is note-for-note solos, in which some players precisely recreate a famous version of a solo, such as a [[guitar solo]].\n\n==Philosophy and aesthetics==\n{{Further|Aesthetics of music}}\n[[File:Boldini, Woman in Red.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Painting by [[Boldini]] of a woman playing the piano]]\n[[Philosophy of music]] is a subfield of philosophy. The philosophy of music is the study of fundamental questions regarding music. The philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions in [[metaphysics]] and [[aesthetics]].\nSome basic questions in the philosophy of music are:\n\n* What is the [[definition of music]]? (What are the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for classifying something as music?)\n* What is the relationship between music and mind?\n* What does [[music history]] reveal to us about the world?\n* What is the connection between music and emotions?\n* What is meaning in relation to music?\n\nIn ancient times, such as with the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], the [[aesthetics of music]] explored the mathematical and [[cosmological]] dimensions of [[rhythm]]ic and harmonic organization. In the 18th century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music. The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant]]. Through their writing, the ancient term 'aesthetics', meaning [[sensory perception]], received its present-day connotation. In the 2000s, philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn the 20th century, important contributions were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a [[music critic]] and [[musicologist]], and composer [[Richard Wagner]] regarding whether music can express meaning. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Also many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a scale called [[just intonation]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIt is often thought that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The [[philosopher]] [[Plato]] suggests in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII).{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThere has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Psychology==\nModern [[music psychology]] aims to explain and understand musical [[behavior]] and [[experience]].&lt;ref name = Tan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tan |first1=Siu-Lan |last2=Pfordresher |first2=Peter |last3=Harr\u00e9 |first3=Rom |date=2010 |title=Psychology of Music: From Sound to Significance |location=New York |publisher=Psychology Press |page=2 |isbn=978-1-84169-868-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this field and its subfields are primarily [[Empirical research|empirical]]; their knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic [[observation]] of and interaction with [[human subject research|human participants]].

These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion.

Musical performances take different forms in different cultures and socioeconomic milieus. In Europe and North America, there is often a divide between what types of music are viewed as a &quot;[[high culture]]&quot; and &quot;[[low culture]].&quot; &quot;High culture&quot; types of music typically include Western art music such as Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and modern-era symphonies, concertos, and solo works, and are typically heard in formal concerts in concert halls and churches, with the audience sitting quietly in seats.\n\nOther types of music\u2014including, but not limited to, jazz, blues, [[soul music|soul]], and [[country music|country]]\u2014are often performed in bars, nightclubs, and theatres, where the audience may be able to drink, dance, and express themselves by cheering. Until the later 20th century, the division between &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; musical forms was widely accepted as a valid distinction that separated out better quality, more advanced &quot;art music&quot; from the popular styles of music heard in bars and dance halls.\n\nHowever, in the 1980s and 1990s, musicologists studying this perceived divide between &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; musical genres argued that this distinction is not based on the musical value or quality of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Rather, they argued that this distinction was based largely on the [[socioeconomic]]s standing or social class of the performers or audience of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} For example, whereas the audience for Classical symphony concerts typically have above-average incomes, the audience for a rap concert in an inner-city area may have below-average incomes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Even though the performers, audience, or venue where non-&quot;art&quot; music is performed may have a lower socioeconomic status, the music that is performed, such as blues, rap, [[Punk rock|punk]], [[funk]], or [[ska]] may be very complex and sophisticated.\n\nWhen composers introduce styles of music that break with convention, there can be a strong resistance from academic music experts and popular culture. Late-period Beethoven string quartets, Stravinsky ballet scores, [[serialism]], [[bebop]]-era jazz, hip hop, punk rock, and [[electronica]] have all been considered non-music by some critics when they were first introduced.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Such themes are examined in the sociology of music. The sociological study of music, sometimes called [[sociomusicology]], is often pursued in departments of sociology, media studies, or music, and is closely related to the field of [[ethnomusicology]].\n\n===Role of women===\n{{Main|Women in music}}\n[[File:Julius Giere - Clara Wieck im Alter von 15 Jahren (Lithographie 1835).jpg|thumb|right|19th-century composer and pianist [[Clara Schumann]]]]\nWomen have played a major role in music throughout history, as composers, songwriters, [[Musician|instrumental performers]], singers, conductors, [[musicology|music scholars]], [[music teacher|music educators]], [[music criticism|music critics]]/[[music journalist]]s and other musical professions. As well, it describes music movements, events and genres related to women, [[women's rights|women's issues]] and [[feminism]]. In the 2010s, while women comprise a significant proportion of [[popular music]] and classical music singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being singer-songwriters), there are few women record producers, [[music journalist|rock critics]] and rock instrumentalists. Although there have been a huge number of [[List of women composers|women composers]] in classical music, from the Medieval period to the present day, women composers are significantly underrepresented in the [[Western canon|commonly performed classical music repertoire]], music history textbooks and music encyclopedias; for example, in the ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is one of the only female composers who is mentioned.\n\nWomen comprise a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]] were men. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked [[Vienna Philharmonic]] orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and [[all-female band]]s. Women are particularly underrepresented in [[extreme metal]] genres.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. &quot;Grunting Alone?

Since the 20th century, live music can also be broadcast over the radio, television or the Internet, or [[sound recording|recorded]] and listened to on a [[CD player]] or Mp3 player. \n\nSome musical styles focus on producing songs and pieces for a live performance, while others focus on producing a recording that mixes together sounds that were never played &quot;live.&quot; Even in essentially live styles such as rock, recording engineers often use the ability to [[Multitrack recording|edit, splice and mix]] to produce recordings that may be considered &quot;better&quot; than the actual live performance. For example, some singers record themselves singing a melody and then record multiple harmony parts using overdubbing, creating a sound that would be impossible to do live.\n\n[[Music technology|Technology]] has had an influence on music since prehistoric times, when cave people used simple tools to bore holes into bone flutes 41,000 years ago. Technology continued to influence music throughout the history of music, as it enabled new instruments and music notation reproduction systems to be used, with one of the watershed moments in music notation being the invention of the [[printing press]] in the 1400s, which meant music scores no longer had to be hand copied. In the 19th century, music technology led to the development of a more powerful, louder piano and led to the development of new valves brass instruments. \n\nIn the early 20th century (in the late 1920s), as [[sound film|talking pictures]] emerged in the early 20th century, with their prerecorded musical tracks, an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php |title=American Federation of Musicians/History |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405035855/http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php |archivedate=2007-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, live musical performances by orchestras, pianists, and [[theater organ]]ists were common at first-run theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard (1985), p. 429.{{incomplete short citation|date=July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the coming of the talking motion pictures, those featured performances were largely eliminated. The [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM) took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices. One 1929 ad that appeared in the ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'' features an image of a can labeled &quot;Canned Music / Big Noise Brand / Guaranteed to Produce No Intellectual or Emotional Reaction Whatever&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/adaccess.R0206/ &quot;Canned Music on Trial&quot;] part of [[Duke University]]'s ''Ad*Access'' project.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSince legislation introduced to help protect performers, composers, publishers and producers, including the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] of 1992 in the United States, and the 1979 revised [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] in the United Kingdom, recordings and live performances have also become more accessible through computers, devices and Internet in a form that is commonly known as [[Music-On-Demand]].\n\nIn many cultures, there is less distinction between performing and listening to music, since virtually everyone is involved in some sort of musical activity, often in a communal setting. In industrialized countries, listening to music through a recorded form, such as [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] on record or radio became more common than experiencing live performance, roughly in the middle of the 20th century. By the 1980s, watching [[music video]]s was a popular way to listen to music, while also seeing the performers.\n\nSometimes, live performances incorporate prerecorded sounds. For example, a [[disc jockey]] uses [[gramophone record|disc records]] for [[scratching]], and some 20th-century works have a solo for an instrument or voice that is performed along with music that is prerecorded onto a tape. Some pop bands use recorded [[backing tracks]]. Computers and many [[keyboard (computing)|keyboards]] can be programmed to produce and play [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI) music. Audiences can also ''become'' performers by participating in [[karaoke]], an activity of Japanese origin centered on a device that plays voice-eliminated versions of well-known songs. Most karaoke machines also have video screens that show lyrics to songs being performed; performers can follow the lyrics as they sing over the instrumental tracks.\n\n===The Internet===\n\nThe advent of the Internet and widespread high-speed broadband access has transformed the experience of music, partly through the increased ease of access to recordings of music via [[streaming video]] and vastly increased choice of music for consumers. [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]], in his book ''[[The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More]]'', suggests that while the traditional economic model of [[supply and demand]] describes scarcity, the Internet retail model is based on abundance. [[Data storage device|Digital storage]] costs are low, so a company can afford to make its whole recording inventory available online, giving customers as much choice as possible. It has thus become economically viable to offer music recordings that very few people are interested in. Consumers' growing awareness of their increased choice results in a closer association between listening tastes and social identity, and the creation of thousands of [[niche market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Chris (2006). The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More. Hyperion. {{ISBN|1-4013-0237-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAnother effect of the Internet arose with [[Virtual community|online communities]] and [[social media]] websites like YouTube and Facebook, a [[social networking service]]. These sites make it easier for aspiring singers and amateur bands to distribute videos of their songs, connect with other musicians, and gain audience interest. Professional musicians also use YouTube as a free publisher of promotional material. YouTube users, for example, no longer only download and listen to MP3s, but also actively create their own. According to [[Don Tapscott]] and [[Anthony D. Williams (author)|Anthony D. Williams]], in their book ''[[Wikinomics]]'', there has been a shift from a traditional consumer role to what they call a &quot;[[prosumer]]&quot; role, a consumer who both creates content and consumes. Manifestations of this in music include the production of [[mashup (music)|mashes]], [[remix]]es, and music videos by fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tapscott |first=Don |authorlink=Don Tapscott |author2=Williams, Anthony D. |authorlink2=Anthony D.

It consists of songwriters and composers who create new songs and musical pieces, music producers and [[sound engineer]]s who record songs and pieces, record labels and [[Music publisher (popular music)|publishers]] that distribute recorded music products and [[sheet music]] internationally and that often control the rights to those products. Some music labels are &quot;[[independent record label|independent]],&quot; while others are subsidiaries of larger corporate entities or international [[media conglomerate|media groups]]. In the 2000s, the increasing popularity of listening to music as digital music files on MP3 players, iPods, or computers, and of trading music on [[file sharing]] websites or buying it online in the form of digital files had a major impact on the traditional music business. Many smaller independent [[CD store]]s went out of business as music buyers decreased their purchases of CDs, and many labels had lower CD sales. Some companies did well with the change to a digital format, though, such as Apple's [[iTunes]], an [[online music store]] that sells digital files of songs over the Internet.\n\n===Intellectual property laws===\n{{Main|Royalty payment#Music royalties}}\nIn spite of some [[international copyright treaties]], determining which music is in the [[public domain]] is complicated by [[:Category:copyright law by country|the variety]] of national [[copyright law]]s that may be applicable.  [[US copyright law]] formerly protected printed music published after 1923 for 28 years and with renewal for another 28 years, but the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] made renewal automatic, and the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] changed the calculation of the copyright term to 70 years after the death of the creator. Recorded sound falls under [[mechanical licensing]], often covered by a confusing patchwork of state laws; most [[cover version]]s are licensed through the [[Harry Fox Agency]]. [[Performance rights]] may be obtained by either performers or the performance venue; the two major organizations for licensing are [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] and [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]]. Two online sources for [[public domain music]] are [[International Music Score Library Project|IMSLP (International Music Score Library Project)]] and [[Choral Public Domain Library|Choral Public Domain Library (CPDL)]].\n\n==Education==\n\n===Non-professional===\n{{Main|Music education}}\n[[File:Suzuki violin recital.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A [[Suzuki method|Suzuki]] violin recital with students of varying ages]]\nThe incorporation of some music or singing training into general education from [[Preschool education|preschool]] to [[Higher education|post secondary education]] is common in North America and Europe. Involvement in playing and singing music is thought to teach basic skills such as concentration, [[counting]], listening, and cooperation while also promoting understanding of [[language]], improving the ability to [[memory|recall]] information, and creating an environment more conducive to learning in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;Woodall and Ziembroski, 2002{{incomplete short citation|date=July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In elementary schools, children often learn to play instruments such as the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], sing in small choirs, and learn about the history of Western art music and traditional music. Some elementary school children also learn about popular music styles. In religious schools, children sing [[hymn]]s and other religious music. In secondary schools (and less commonly in elementary schools), students may have the opportunity to perform in some types of musical ensembles, such as [[choir]]s (a group of singers), [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s, jazz bands, or orchestras. In some school systems, music lessons on how to play instruments may be provided. Some students also take private [[music lesson]]s after school with a singing teacher or instrument teacher. Amateur musicians typically learn basic musical rudiments (e.g., learning about [[musical notation]] for [[musical scale]]s and rhythms) and beginner- to intermediate-level singing or instrument-playing techniques.\n\nAt the university level, students in most arts and [[humanities]] programs can receive [[Credit (education)|credit]] for taking a few music courses, which typically take the form of an overview course on the [[history of music]], or a [[music appreciation]] course that focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles. In addition, most North American and European universities have some types of musical ensembles that students in arts and humanities are able to participate in, such as choirs, marching bands, concert bands, or orchestras. The study of Western art music is increasingly common outside of North America and Europe, such as the [[Indonesian Institute of the Arts, Yogyakarta|Indonesian Institute of the Arts]] in [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]], or the classical music programs that are available in Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, and China. At the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of non-Western cultures, such as the [[music of Africa]] or Bali (e.g. [[Gamelan]] music).\n\n===Professional training===\n[[File:TimothyBCobb.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Manhattan School of Music]] professor and professional double bass player [[Timothy Cobb]] teaching a bass lesson in the late 2000s. His bass has a low C extension with a metal &quot;machine&quot; with buttons for playing the pitches on the extension.]]\nIndividuals aiming to become professional musicians, singers, composers, songwriters, music teachers and practitioners of other music-related professions such as [[music history]] professors, [[sound engineer]]s, and so on study in specialized post-secondary programs offered by colleges, universities and [[music conservatory|music conservatories]].  Some institutions that train individuals for careers in music offer training in a wide range of professions, as is the case with many of the top U.S. universities, which offer degrees in music performance (including singing and playing instruments), music history, music theory, music composition, [[music education]] (for individuals aiming to become elementary or high school music teachers) and, in some cases, conducting. On the other hand, some small colleges may only offer training in a single profession (e.g., [[sound recording]]).\n\nWhile most university and conservatory music programs focus on training students in classical music, there are a number of universities and colleges that train musicians for careers as [[jazz]] or [[popular music]] musicians and composers, with notable U.S. examples including the [[Manhattan School of Music]] and the [[Berklee College of Music]]. Two important schools in Canada which offer professional jazz training are [[McGill University]] and [[Humber College]]. Individuals aiming at careers in some types of music, such as [[heavy metal music]], [[country music]] or [[blues]] are less likely to become professionals by completing degrees or diplomas in colleges or universities. Instead, they typically learn about their style of music by singing and/or playing in many bands (often beginning in amateur bands, [[cover band]]s and [[tribute band]]s), studying recordings available on CD, DVD and the Internet and working with already-established professionals in their style of music, either through informal [[mentoring]] or regular [[music lesson]]s. Since the 2000s, the increasing popularity and availability of Internet forums and YouTube &quot;how-to&quot; videos have enabled many singers and musicians from metal, blues and similar genres to improve their skills. Many pop, rock and country singers train informally with [[vocal coach]]es and [[singing teacher]]s.\n\n====Undergraduate====\n[[Undergraduate education|Undergraduate]] [[academic degree|university degrees]] in music, including the [[Bachelor of Music]], the Bachelor of Music Education, and the Bachelor of Arts (with a major in music) typically take about four years to complete. These degrees provide students with a grounding in music theory and music history, and many students also study an instrument or learn singing technique as part of their program. Graduates of undergraduate music programs can seek employment or go on to further study in music graduate programs. Bachelor's degree graduates are also eligible to apply to some graduate programs and [[professional school]]s outside of music (e.g., [[public administration]], [[business administration]], [[library science]], and, in some jurisdictions, [[teachers college|teacher's college]], [[law school]] or [[medical school]]).\n\n====Graduate====\nGraduate music degrees include the [[Master of Music]], the Master of Arts (in musicology, music theory or another music field), the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) (e.g., in musicology or music theory), and more recently, the [[Doctor of Musical Arts]], or DMA. The Master of Music degree, which takes one to two years to complete, is typically awarded to students studying the performance of an instrument, education, voice (singing) or composition. The Master of Arts degree, which takes one to two years to complete and often requires a [[Dissertation|thesis]], is typically awarded to students studying musicology, music history, music theory or ethnomusicology.\n\nThe PhD, which is required for students who want to work as university professors in musicology, music history, or music theory, takes three to five years of study after the master's degree, during which time the student will complete advanced courses and undertake research for a dissertation. The DMA is a relatively new degree that was created to provide a credential for professional performers or composers that want to work as university professors in musical performance or composition. The DMA takes three to five years after a master's degree, and includes advanced courses, projects, and performances. In Medieval times, the study of music was one of the [[Quadrivium]] of the seven [[liberal arts|Liberal Arts]] and considered vital to higher learning. Within the quantitative Quadrivium, music, or more accurately [[harmonic]]s, was the study of rational proportions.\n\n====Musicology====\n[[Musicology]], the academic study of the subject of music, is studied in universities and music conservatories. The earliest definitions from the 19th century defined three sub-disciplines of musicology: [[systematic musicology]], [[Music history|historical musicology]], and comparative musicology or [[ethnomusicology]]. In 2010-era scholarship, one is more likely to encounter a division of the discipline into [[music theory]], [[music history]], and [[ethnomusicology]]. Research in musicology has often been enriched by cross-disciplinary work, for example in the field of [[psychoacoustics]]. The study of music of non-Western cultures, and the cultural study of music, is called ethnomusicology. Students can pursue the undergraduate study of musicology, ethnomusicology, [[music history]], and music theory through several different types of degrees, including bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and PhD degrees.\n\n====Music theory====\n[[Music theory]] is the study of music, generally in a highly technical manner outside of other disciplines. More broadly it refers to any study of music, usually related in some form with compositional concerns, and may include [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[anthropology]]. What is most commonly taught in beginning music theory classes are guidelines to write in the style of the [[common practice period]], or [[Tonality|tonal music]]. Theory, even of music of the common practice period, may take many other forms. [[Set theory (music)|Musical set theory]] is the application of mathematical [[set theory]] to music, first applied to [[Atonality|atonal music]]. ''Speculative music theory'', contrasted with ''analytic music theory'', is devoted to the analysis and synthesis of music materials, for example [[musical tuning|tuning systems]], generally as preparation for composition.\n\n====Zoomusicology====\n[[Zoomusicology]] is the study of the music of non-human animals, or the musical aspects of sounds produced by non-human animals. As George Herzog (1941) asked, &quot;do animals have music?&quot; [[Fran\u00e7ois-Bernard M\u00e2che]]'s ''Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion'' (1983), a study of &quot;ornitho-musicology&quot; using a technique of [[Nicolas Ruwet]]'s ''Langage&lt;!--Langage=parlance or mode of speech--&gt;, musique, po\u00e9sie'' (1972) [[Paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic segmentation analysis]], shows that [[Bird vocalization|bird songs]] are organised according to a repetition-transformation principle. Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1990), argues that &quot;in the last analysis, it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical, even when the sound is not of human origin. If we acknowledge that sound is not organised and conceptualised (that is, made to form music) merely by its producer, but by the mind that perceives it, then music is uniquely human.&quot;\n\n====Ethnomusicology====\n{{Main|Ethnomusicology}}\n[[File:Frances Densmore recording Mountain Chief2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Ethnomusicologist [[Frances Densmore]] recording [[Blackfoot]] chief [[Mountain Chief]] for the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]] (1916)]]\nIn the West, much of the history of music that is taught deals with the Western civilization's art music, which is known as classical music. The history of music in non-Western cultures (&quot;[[world music]]&quot; or the field of &quot;ethnomusicology&quot;), which typically covers music from\nAfrica and Asia is also taught in Western universities. This includes the documented classical traditions of Asian countries outside the influence of Western Europe, as well as the folk or indigenous music of various other cultures. Popular or folk styles of music in non-Western countries varied widely from culture to culture, and from period to period. Different cultures emphasised different [[musical instrument|instruments]], techniques, singing styles and uses for music. Music has been used for entertainment, ceremonies, rituals, religious purposes and for practical and artistic communication. Non-Western music has also been used for propaganda purposes, as was the case with [[Chinese opera]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]].\n\nThere is a host of music classifications for non-Western music, many of which are caught up in the argument over the [[definition of music]]. Among the largest of these is the division between classical music (or &quot;art&quot; music), and popular music (or [[Contemporary commercial music|commercial music]] \u2013 including non-Western styles of rock, [[country music|country]], and pop music-related styles). Some genres do not fit neatly into one of these &quot;big two&quot; classifications, (such as [[folk music]], [[world music]], or [[jazz]]-related music).\n\nAs world cultures have come into [[Globalization|greater global contact]], their indigenous musical styles have often merged with other styles, which produces new styles. For example, the United States [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] style contains elements from [[Folk Music of England|Anglo]]-[[Music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Music of Scotland|Scottish]], Irish, [[Music of Germany|German]] and African instrumental and vocal traditions, which were able to fuse in the United States' multi-ethnic &quot;[[melting pot]]&quot; society. Some types of world music contain a mixture of non-Western indigenous styles with Western pop music elements. Genres of music are determined as much by tradition and presentation as by the actual music. Some works, like [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', are claimed by both jazz and classical music, while Gershwin's ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' and [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' are claimed by both opera and the [[Broadway musical]] tradition. Many current music festivals for non-Western music include bands and singers from a particular musical genre, such as world music.\n\n[[Music of India|Indian music]], for example, is one of the oldest and longest living types of music, and is still widely heard and performed in South Asia, as well as internationally (especially since the 1960s). Indian music has mainly three forms of classical music, [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]], [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]], and [[Dhrupad]] styles. It has also a large repertoire of styles, which involve only percussion music such as the talavadya performances famous in [[South India]].\n\n==Music therapy==\n[[File:USMC-05376.jpg|thumb|right|A music therapist from a &quot;Blues in the Schools&quot; program plays harmonica with a US Navy sailor at a Naval Therapy Center.]]\n[[Music therapy]] is an interpersonal process in which a trained therapist uses music and all of its facets\u2014physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual\u2014to help clients to improve or maintain their health. In some instances, the client's needs are addressed directly through music; in others they are addressed through the relationships that develop between the client and therapist. Music therapy is used with individuals of all ages and with a variety of conditions, including: psychiatric disorders, medical problems, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, developmental disabilities, substance abuse issues, communication disorders, interpersonal problems, and aging. It is also used to improve learning, build self-esteem, reduce stress, [[Exercise and music|support physical exercise]], and facilitate a host of other health-related activities. Music therapists may encourage clients to sing, play instruments, create songs, or do other musical activities.\n\nOne of the earliest mentions of music therapy was in [[Al-Farabi]]'s (c. 872\u2013950) treatise ''Meanings of the Intellect'', which described the therapeutic effects of music on the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haque |first1=Amber |year=2004 |title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists |url= |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=357\u2013377 [363] |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z|s2cid=38740431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2011}} Music has long been used to help people deal with their emotions. In the 17th century, the scholar [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' argued that music and dance were critical in treating [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], especially [[melancholia]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'', [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]], subsection 3, on and after line 3,480, &quot;Music a Remedy&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that music has an &quot;excellent power ...to expel many other diseases&quot; and he called it &quot;a sovereign remedy against despair and melancholy.&quot; He pointed out that in Antiquity, Canus, a Rhodian fiddler, used music to &quot;make a melancholy man merry, ...a lover more enamoured, a religious man more devout.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ismenias the Theban, Chiron the centaur, is said to have cured this and many other diseases by music alone: as now thy do those, saith Bodine, that are troubled with St. Vitus's Bedlam dance.

In some interviews Einstein even attributed much of his scientific intuition to music, with his son Hans recounting that &quot;whenever he felt that he had come to the end of the road or into a difficult situation in his work, he would take refuge in music, and that would usually resolve all his difficulties.&quot; Something in the music, according to Michele and Robert Root-Bernstein in ''[[Psychology Today]]'', &quot;would guide his thoughts in new and creative directions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/imagine/201003/einstein-creative-thinking-music-and-the-intuitive-art-scientific-imagination |title=Einstein On Creative Thinking: Music and the Intuitive Art of Scientific Imagination|author1-last=Root-Bernstein|author1-first=Michele|author2-last=Root-Bernstein|author2-first=Robert |magazine=Psychology Today |date=March 31, 2010 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that Einstein considered Mozart's music to reveal a universal harmony that Einstein believed existed in the universe, &quot;as if the great Wolfgang Amadeus did not 'create' his beautifully clear music at all, but simply discovered it already made.

Medicine encompasses a variety of [[health care]] practices evolved to maintain and restore [[health]] by the [[prevention (medical)|prevention]] and [[therapy|treatment]] of [[illness]]. Contemporary medicine applies [[biomedical sciences]], [[biomedical research]], [[medical genetics|genetics]], and [[medical technology]] to [[diagnosis (medical)|diagnose]], treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through [[pharmaceutical]]s or [[surgery]], but also through therapies as diverse as [[psychotherapy]], [[splint (medicine)|external splints and traction]], [[medical device]]s, [[biologic medical product|biologics]], and [[Radiation (medicine)|ionizing radiation]], amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/medicine | title=Dictionary, medicine | access-date=2 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nMedicine has been practiced since [[Prehistoric medicine|prehistoric times]], during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the [[religion|religious]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] beliefs of local culture. For example, a [[medicine man]] would apply herbs and say [[prayer]]s for healing, or an ancient philosopher and [[physician]] would apply [[bloodletting]] according to the theories of [[humorism]]. In recent centuries, since the [[history of science|advent of modern science]], most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both [[fundamental science|basic]] and [[applied science|applied]], under the [[umbrella term|umbrella]] of '''medical science'''). While stitching technique for [[surgical suture|sutures]] is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the [[cytology|cellular]] and [[molecular medicine|molecular]] level in the tissues being stitched arises through science.\n\nPrescientific forms of medicine are now known as [[traditional medicine]] and [[folk medicine]]. They remain commonly used with, or instead of, scientific medicine and are thus called [[alternative medicine]]. As an example, evidence on the effectiveness of [[acupuncture]] is &quot;variable and inconsistent&quot; for any condition,&lt;ref name=Colquhoun2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Colquhoun D, Novella SP | title = Acupuncture is theatrical placebo | journal = Anesthesia and Analgesia | volume = 116 | issue = 6 | pages = 1360\u20133 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23709076 | doi = 10.1213/ANE.0b013e31828f2d5e | url = http://www.dcscience.net/Colquhoun-Novella-A&amp;A-2013.pdf | authorlink = David Colquhoun }}&lt;/ref&gt; but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner.&lt;ref name=&quot;nciacupuncture&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Acupuncture (PDQ\u00ae)|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/acupuncture/healthprofessional/page6|publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]]|access-date=15 Sep 2013|date=2005-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, alternative treatments outside the bounds not just of scientific medicine, but also outside the bounds of safety and efficacy are termed [[quackery]]. This can encompass an array of practices and practitioners, irrespective of whether they are prescientific (traditional medicine and folk medicine) or modern [[pseudo-scientific]], including [[chiropractic]] which rejects modern scientific [[germ theory of disease]] (instead believing without evidence that human diseases are caused by invisible [[subluxation]] of the bones, predominantly of the spine and less so of other bones), with just over half of chiropractors also rejecting the science of [[immunization]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\n\nMedicine ({{IPAc-en|UK|\u02c8|m|\u025b|d|s|\u1d7b|n|audio=En-uk-medicine.ogg}}, {{IPAc-en|US|\u02c8|m|\u025b|d|\u1d7b|s|\u1d7b|n|audio=En-us-medicine.ogg}}) is the [[science]] and practice of the [[diagnosis]], [[prognosis]], [[therapy|treatment]], and [[Preventive medicine|prevention]] of [[disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Medicine, n.1 |url= http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/115715?result=1&amp;rskey=YZWqVc&amp; |encyclopedia=OED Online |date=September 2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=8 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Medicine |url= http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/medicine?q=medicine |encyclopedia=[[Oxford Dictionaries Online]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=8 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;medicine&quot; is derived from [[Latin]] ''medicus'', meaning &quot;a physician&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Etymology: {{lang-la|medicina}}, from ''ars medicina'' &quot;the medical art&quot;, from ''medicus'' &quot;physician&quot;.

These are the '[[symptom]]s.' They are in the patient's own words and are recorded along with the duration of each one. Also called 'chief concern' or 'presenting complaint'.\n* History of present [[illness]] (HPI): the chronological order of events of symptoms and further clarification of each symptom. Distinguishable from history of previous illness, often called past medical history (PMH). [[Medical history]] comprises HPI and PMH.\n* Current activity: occupation, hobbies, what the patient actually does.\n* [[Medication]]s (Rx): what drugs the patient takes including [[Medical prescription|prescribed]], [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]], and [[Home remedy|home remedies]], as well as alternative and [[Herbalism|herbal medicines/herbal remedies]]. [[Allergy|Allergies]] are also recorded.\n* Past medical history (PMH/PMHx): concurrent medical problems, past hospitalizations and operations, injuries, past [[infectious disease]]s or [[vaccination]]s, history of known allergies.\n* Social history (SH): birthplace, residences, marital history, social and economic status, habits (including [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], medications, [[tobacco smoking|tobacco]], alcohol).\n* [[Family history (medicine)|Family history]] (FH): listing of diseases in the family that may impact the patient. A [[family tree]] is sometimes used.\n* Review of systems (ROS) or ''systems inquiry'': a set of additional questions to ask, which may be missed on HPI: a general enquiry (have you noticed any [[weight loss]], change in sleep quality, fevers, lumps and bumps? etc.), followed by questions on the body's main organ systems ([[human heart|heart]], [[human lung|lungs]], [[digestive tract]], [[Urinary system|urinary tract]], etc.).\n\nThe [[physical examination]] is the examination of the patient for [[medical sign]]s of disease, which are objective and observable, in contrast to symptoms that are volunteered by the patient and not necessarily objectively observable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/161858.php What Are Symptoms?

This is intended to ensure that the entire population has access to medical care on the basis of need rather than ability to pay. Delivery may be via private medical practices or by state-owned hospitals and clinics, or by charities, most commonly by a combination of all three.\n\nMost [[tribe|tribal]] societies provide no guarantee of healthcare for the population as a whole. In such societies, healthcare is available to those that can afford to pay for it or have self-insured it (either directly or as part of an employment contract) or who may be covered by care financed by the government or tribe directly.\n\n[[File:Drug ampoule JPN.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=collection of glass bottles of different sizes|Modern drug [[ampoule]]s]]\n\nTransparency of information is another factor defining a delivery system. Access to information on conditions, treatments, quality, and pricing greatly affects the choice by patients/consumers and, therefore, the incentives of medical professionals. While the US healthcare system has come under fire for lack of openness,&lt;ref&gt;\n{{cite journal | first = Martin | last = Sipkoff | name-list-format = vanc | title = Transparency called key to uniting cost control, quality improvement | journal = Managed Care | date = January 2004 | url = http://www.managedcaremag.com/archives/0401/0401.forum.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; new legislation may encourage greater openness. There is a perceived tension between the need for transparency on the one hand and such issues as patient confidentiality and the possible exploitation of information for commercial gain on the other.\n\n===Delivery===\n{{See also|Health care|clinic|hospital|hospice}}\n\nProvision of medical care is classified into primary, secondary, and tertiary care categories.\n\n[[File:Nurses at Butawin Urban Clinic, PNG (10711159465).jpg|thumb|alt=photograph of three nurses|Nurses in [[Kokopo]], [[East New Britain]], [[Papua New Guinea]]|upright]]\n[[Primary care]] medical services are provided by [[physician]]s, [[physician assistant]]s, [[nurse practitioner]]s, or other health professionals who have first contact with a patient seeking medical treatment or care. These occur in physician offices, [[clinic]]s, [[nursing home]]s, schools, home visits, and other places close to patients. About 90% of medical visits can be treated by the primary care provider. These include treatment of acute and chronic illnesses, [[preventive care]] and [[health education]] for all ages and both sexes.\n\n[[Secondary care]] medical services are provided by [[medical specialist]]s in their offices or clinics or at local community hospitals for a patient referred by a primary care provider who first diagnosed or treated the patient. Referrals are made for those patients who required the expertise or procedures performed by specialists. These include both [[ambulatory care]] and [[inpatient]] services, [[Emergency department]]s, [[intensive care medicine]], surgery services, [[physical therapy]], [[childbirth|labor and delivery]], [[endoscopy]] units, diagnostic [[Medical laboratory|laboratory]] and [[medical imaging]] services, [[Hospice care|hospice]] centers, etc. Some primary care providers may also take care of hospitalized patients and deliver babies in a secondary care setting.\n\n[[Tertiary care]] medical services are provided by specialist hospitals or regional centers equipped with diagnostic and treatment facilities not generally available at local hospitals. These include [[trauma center]]s, [[burn (injury)|burn]] treatment centers, advanced [[neonatology]] unit services, [[organ transplant]]s, high-risk pregnancy, [[radiation therapy|radiation]] [[oncology]], etc.\n\nModern medical care also depends on information \u2013 still delivered in many health care settings on paper records, but increasingly nowadays by [[Electronic health record|electronic means]].\n\nIn low-income countries, modern healthcare is often too expensive for the average person. International healthcare policy researchers have advocated that &quot;user fees&quot; be removed in these areas to ensure access, although even after removal, significant costs and barriers remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Laokri S, Weil O, Drabo KM, Dembel\u00e9 SM, Kafando B, Dujardin B | title = Removal of user fees no guarantee of universal health coverage: observations from Burkina Faso | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 91 | issue = 4 | pages = 277\u201382 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23599551 | pmc = 3629451 | doi = 10.2471/BLT.12.110015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Separation of prescribing and dispensing]] is a practice in medicine and pharmacy in which the [[physician]] who provides a [[medical prescription]] is independent from the  [[pharmacist]] who provides the [[prescription drug]].

[[Dentistry]], while considered by some a separate discipline from medicine, is a medical field.\n\nA patient admitted to the hospital is usually under the care of a specific team based on their main presenting problem, e.g., the cardiology team, who then may interact with other specialties, e.g., surgical, radiology, to help diagnose or treat the main problem or any subsequent complications/developments.\n\nPhysicians have many specializations and subspecializations into certain branches of medicine, which are listed below. There are variations from country to country regarding which specialties certain subspecialties are in.\n\nThe main branches of medicine are:\n* Basic sciences of medicine; this is what every physician is educated in, and some return to in [[Biomedical research#Preclinical research|biomedical research]]\n* [[Medical specialties]]\n* [[Interdisciplinary sub-specialties of medicine|Interdisciplinary fields]], where different medical specialties are mixed to function in certain occasions.\n\n===Basic sciences===\n* ''[[Anatomy]]'' is the study of the physical structure of [[organism]]s. In contrast to ''macroscopic'' or ''gross anatomy'', ''cytology'' and ''histology'' are concerned with microscopic structures.\n* ''[[Biochemistry]]'' is the study of the chemistry taking place in living organisms, especially the structure and function of their chemical components.\n* ''[[Biomechanics]]'' is the study of the structure and function of biological systems by means of the methods of [[Mechanics]].\n* ''[[Biostatistics]]'' is the application of statistics to biological fields in the broadest sense. A knowledge of biostatistics is essential in the planning, evaluation, and interpretation of medical research. It is also fundamental to [[epidemiology]] and evidence-based medicine.\n* ''[[Biophysics]]'' is an interdisciplinary science that uses the methods of [[physics]] and [[physical chemistry]] to study biological systems.\n* ''[[Cell biology|Cytology]]'' is the microscopic study of individual [[cell (biology)|cells]].\n[[File:Albert Edelfelt - Louis Pasteur - 1885.jpg|thumb|''[[Louis Pasteur]]'', as portrayed in his laboratory, 1885 by [[Albert Edelfelt]]]]\n* ''[[Embryology]]'' is the study of the early development of organisms.\n* ''[[Endocrinology]]'' is the study of hormones and their effect throughout the body of animals.\n* ''[[Epidemiology]]'' is the study of the demographics of disease processes, and includes, but is not limited to, the study of epidemics.\n* ''[[Genetics]]'' is the study of genes, and their role in [[biological inheritance]].\n* ''[[Histology]]'' is the study of the structures of [[biological tissue]]s by light [[microscopy]], [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]] and [[immunohistochemistry]].\n* ''[[Immunology]]'' is the study of the [[immune system]], which includes the innate and adaptive immune system in humans, for example.\n* ''[[Medical physics]]'' is the study of the applications of physics principles in medicine.\n* ''[[Microbiology]]'' is the study of [[microorganism]]s, including [[protozoa]], [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]], and [[virus]]es.\n* ''[[Molecular biology]]'' is the study of molecular underpinnings of the process of [[DNA replication|replication]], [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] of the genetic material.\n* ''[[Neuroscience]]'' includes those disciplines of science that are related to the study of the [[nervous system]]. A main focus of neuroscience is the [[biology]] and physiology of the human brain and [[spinal cord]]. Some related clinical specialties include [[neurology]], [[neurosurgery]] and [[psychiatry]].\n* ''[[Nutrition science]]'' (theoretical focus) and ''[[dietetics]]'' (practical focus) is the study of the relationship of food and drink to health and disease, especially in determining an optimal diet. Medical nutrition therapy is done by dietitians and is prescribed for [[diabetes]], [[cardiovascular disease]]s, weight and eating [[mental illness|disorders]], allergies, [[malnutrition]], and [[neoplasia|neoplastic]] diseases.\n* ''[[Pathology as a science]]'' is the study of disease\u2014the causes, course, progression and resolution thereof.\n* ''[[Pharmacology]]'' is the study of drugs and their actions.\n* ''[[Gynecology]]'' is the study of female reproductive system.\n* ''[[Photobiology]]'' is the study of the interactions between [[non-ionizing radiation]] and living organisms.\n* ''[[Physiology]]'' is the study of the normal functioning of the body and the underlying regulatory mechanisms.\n* ''[[Radiobiology]]'' is the study of the interactions between [[ionizing radiation]] and living organisms.\n* ''[[Toxicology]]'' is the study of hazardous effects of drugs and [[poison]]s.\n\n===Specialties===\n{{Main|Medical specialty}}\nIn the broadest meaning of &quot;medicine&quot;, there are many different specialties. In the UK, most specialities have their own body or college, which has its own entrance examination. These are collectively known as the Royal Colleges, although not all currently use the term &quot;Royal&quot;. The development of a speciality is often driven by new technology (such as the development of effective anaesthetics) or ways of working (such as emergency departments); the new specialty leads to the formation of a unifying body of doctors and the prestige of administering their own examination.\n\nWithin medical circles, specialities usually fit into one of two broad categories: &quot;Medicine&quot; and &quot;Surgery.&quot; &quot;Medicine&quot; refers to the practice of non-operative medicine, and most of its subspecialties require preliminary training in Internal Medicine. In the UK, this was traditionally evidenced by passing the examination for the Membership of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] (MRCP) or the equivalent college in Scotland or Ireland. &quot;Surgery&quot; refers to the practice of operative medicine, and most subspecialties in this area require preliminary training in General Surgery, which in the UK leads to membership of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] (MRCS). At present, some specialties of medicine do not fit easily into either of these categories, such as radiology, pathology, or anesthesia. Most of these have branched from one or other of the two camps above; for example anaesthesia developed first as a [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] of the Royal College of Surgeons (for which MRCS/FRCS would have been required) before becoming the [[Royal College of Anaesthetists]] and membership of the college is attained by sitting for the examination of the Fellowship of the Royal College of Anesthetists (FRCA).\n\n====Surgical specialty====\n{{Main|Surgery}}\n[[File:Surgeons at Work.jpg|thumb|Surgeons in an [[operating room]]]]\n'''Surgery''' is an ancient medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate or treat a [[pathological]] condition such as [[disease]] or [[injury]], to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example, [[Perforated eardrum|a perforated ear drum]]). Surgeons must also manage pre-operative, post-operative, and potential surgical candidates on the hospital wards. Surgery has many sub-specialties, including ''[[general surgery]], [[Ophthalmic Surgery|ophthalmic surgery]], [[cardiovascular surgery]], [[colorectal surgery]], [[neurosurgery]], [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]], [[oncologic surgery]], [[orthopedic surgery]], [[otolaryngology]], [[plastic surgery]], [[podiatric surgery]], [[transplant surgery]], [[trauma surgery]], [[urology]], [[vascular surgery]], and [[pediatric surgery]].'' In some centers, [[anesthesiology]] is part of the division of surgery (for historical and logistical reasons), although it is not a surgical discipline. Other medical specialties may employ surgical procedures, such as [[ophthalmology]] and [[dermatology]], but are not considered surgical sub-specialties per se.\n\nSurgical training in the U.S. requires a minimum of five years of residency after medical school. Sub-specialties of surgery often require seven or more years. In addition, fellowships can last an additional one to three years. Because post-residency fellowships can be competitive, many trainees devote two additional years to research. Thus in some cases surgical training will not finish until more than a decade after medical school. Furthermore, surgical training can be very difficult and time-consuming.\n\n====Internal specialty====\n{{Main|Internal medicine}}\n'''Internal medicine''' is the [[medical specialty]] dealing with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of adult diseases. According to some sources, an emphasis on internal structures is implied.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|five/000063883|internal medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, specialists in internal medicine are commonly called &quot;internists.&quot; Elsewhere, especially in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations, such specialists are often called [[physician]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fowler&quot;&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Fowler HW |title=A Dictionary of Modern English Usage (Wordsworth Collection) (Wordsworth Collection) |publisher=NTC/Contemporary Publishing Company |year=1994 |isbn=978-1-85326-318-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofmo00fowl }}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms, ''internist'' or ''physician'' (in the narrow sense, common outside North America), generally exclude practitioners of gynecology and obstetrics, pathology, psychiatry, and especially surgery and its subspecialities.\n\nBecause their patients are often seriously ill or require complex investigations, internists do much of their work in hospitals. Formerly, many internists were not subspecialized; such ''general physicians'' would see any complex nonsurgical problem; this style of practice has become much less common. In modern urban practice, most internists are subspecialists: that is, they generally limit their medical practice to problems of one organ system or to one particular area of medical knowledge. For example, [[gastroenterology|gastroenterologists]] and [[nephrology|nephrologists]] specialize respectively in diseases of the gut and the kidneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web\n|url=http://www.racp.edu.au/index.cfm?objectid=49EF1EB5-2A57-5487-D74DBAFBAE9143A3\n|title=The Royal Australasian College of Physicians: What are Physicians?\n|access-date=5 Feb 2008\n|publisher=[[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]]\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306053048/http://www.racp.edu.au/index.cfm?objectid=49EF1EB5-2A57-5487-D74DBAFBAE9143A3\n|archive-date=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and some other countries, specialist [[Pediatrics|pediatricians]] and [[Geriatrics|geriatricians]] are also described as ''specialist physicians'' (or internists) who have subspecialized by age of patient rather than by organ system. Elsewhere, especially in North America, general pediatrics is often a form of [[primary care physician|primary care]].\n\nThere are many subspecialities (or subdisciplines) of [[internal medicine]]:\n{{refbegin|3}}\n:*''[[Angiology]]/Vascular Medicine''\n:*''[[Cardiology]]''\n:*''[[Critical care medicine]]''\n:*''[[Endocrinology]]''\n:*''[[Gastroenterology]]''\n:*''[[Geriatrics]]''\n:*''[[Hematology]]''\n:*''[[Hepatology]]''\n:*''[[Infectious disease (medical specialty)|Infectious disease]]''\n:*''[[Nephrology]]''\n:*''[[Neurology]]''\n:*''[[Oncology]]''\n:*''[[Pediatrics]]''\n:*''[[Pulmonology]]/Pneumology/Respirology/chest medicine''\n:*''[[Rheumatology]]''\n:*''[[Sports Medicine]]''{{refend}}\n\nTraining in internal medicine (as opposed to surgical training), varies considerably across the world: see the articles on ''[[medical education]]'' and ''[[physician]]'' for more details. In North America, it requires at least three years of residency training after medical school, which can then be followed by a one- to three-year fellowship in the subspecialties listed above. In general, resident work hours in medicine are less than those in surgery, averaging about 60 hours per week in the US. This difference does not apply in the UK where all doctors are now required by law to work less than 48 hours per week on average.\n\n====Diagnostic specialties====\n* ''[[Clinical laboratory]] sciences'' are the clinical diagnostic services that apply laboratory techniques to diagnosis and management of patients. In the United States, these services are supervised by a pathologist. The personnel that work in these [[medical laboratory]] departments are technically trained staff who do not hold medical degrees, but who usually hold an undergraduate [[medical technology]] degree, who actually perform the [[medical test|tests]], [[assay]]s, and procedures needed for providing the specific services. Subspecialties include [[transfusion medicine]], [[cellular pathology]], [[clinical chemistry]], [[hematology]], [[clinical microbiology]] and [[clinical immunology]].\n* ''[[Pathology as a medical specialty]]'' is the branch of medicine that deals with the study of diseases and the morphologic, physiologic changes produced by them. As a diagnostic specialty, pathology can be considered the basis of modern scientific medical knowledge and plays a large role in [[evidence-based medicine]]. Many modern molecular tests such as [[flow cytometry]], [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), [[immunohistochemistry]], [[cytogenetics]], gene rearrangements studies and [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]] (FISH) fall within the territory of pathology.\n* ''Diagnostic [[radiology]]'' is concerned with imaging of the body, e.g. by [[x-ray]]s, x-ray [[computed tomography]], [[ultrasonography]], and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] [[tomography]]. Interventional radiologists can access areas in the body under imaging for an intervention or diagnostic sampling.\n* ''[[Nuclear medicine]]'' is concerned with studying human organ systems by administering radiolabelled substances (radiopharmaceuticals) to the body, which can then be imaged outside the body by a [[gamma camera]] or a PET scanner. Each radiopharmaceutical consists of two parts: a tracer that is specific for the function under study (e.g., neurotransmitter pathway, metabolic pathway, blood flow, or other), and a radionuclide (usually either a gamma-emitter or a positron emitter). There is a degree of overlap between nuclear medicine and radiology, as evidenced by the emergence of combined devices such as the PET/CT scanner.\n* ''[[Clinical neurophysiology]]'' is concerned with testing the physiology or function of the central and peripheral aspects of the nervous system. These kinds of tests can be divided into recordings of: (1) spontaneous or continuously running electrical activity, or (2) stimulus evoked responses. Subspecialties include [[electroencephalography]], [[electromyography]], [[evoked potential]], [[nerve conduction study]] and [[polysomnography]]. Sometimes these tests are performed by techs without a medical degree, but the interpretation of these tests is done by a medical professional.\n\n====Other major specialties====\nThe following are some major medical specialties that do not directly fit into any of the above-mentioned groups:\n* ''[[Anesthesiology]]'' (also known as ''anaesthetics''): concerned with the perioperative management of the surgical patient. The anesthesiologist's role during surgery is to prevent derangement in the vital organs' (i.e. brain, heart, kidneys) functions and postoperative pain. Outside of the operating room, the anesthesiology physician also serves the same function in the labor and delivery ward, and some are specialized in critical medicine.\n* ''[[Dermatology]]'' is concerned with the skin and its diseases. In the UK, dermatology is a subspecialty of general medicine.\n* ''[[Emergency medicine]]'' is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of acute or life-threatening conditions, including [[physical trauma|trauma]], surgical, medical, pediatric, and psychiatric emergencies.\n* ''[[Family medicine]]'', ''[[family practice]]'', ''[[general practice]]'' or ''primary care'' is, in many countries, the first port-of-call for patients with non-emergency medical problems. Family physicians often provide services across a broad range of settings including office based practices, emergency department coverage, inpatient care, and nursing home care.\n[[File:Changing lives for girls and women every week (12330467294).jpg|thumb|[[Gynecologist]] Michel Akotionga of [[Ouagadougou]], [[Burkina Faso]]]]\n* ''[[Obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]]'' (often abbreviated as ''[[OB/GYN]]'' (American English) or ''Obs &amp; Gynae'' (British English)) are concerned respectively with childbirth and the female reproductive and associated organs. [[Reproductive medicine]] and [[fertility medicine]] are generally practiced by gynecological specialists.\n* ''[[Medical genetics]]'' is concerned with the diagnosis and management of hereditary disorders.\n* ''[[Neurology]]'' is concerned with diseases of the nervous system. In the UK, neurology is a subspecialty of general medicine.\n* ''[[Ophthalmology]]'' is exclusively concerned with the eye and ocular adnexa, combining conservative and surgical therapy.\n* ''[[Pediatrics]]'' (AE) or ''paediatrics'' (BE) is devoted to the care of infants, children, and adolescents. Like internal medicine, there are many pediatric subspecialties for specific age ranges, organ systems, disease classes, and sites of care delivery.\n* ''[[Pharmaceutical medicine]]'' is the medical scientific discipline concerned with the discovery, development, evaluation, registration, monitoring and medical aspects of marketing of medicines for the benefit of patients and public health.\n* ''[[Physical medicine and rehabilitation]]'' (or ''physiatry'') is concerned with functional improvement after injury, illness, or [[congenital disorder]]s.\n* ''[[Podiatric medicine]]'' is the study of, diagnosis, and medical &amp; surgical treatment of disorders of the foot, ankle, lower limb, hip and lower back.\n* ''[[Psychiatry]]'' is the branch of medicine concerned with the [[biopsychosocial|bio-psycho-social]] study of the [[etiology]], diagnosis, treatment and prevention of [[cognitive]], [[perceptual]], [[emotional]] and [[behavioral]] disorders. Related non-medical fields include [[psychotherapy]] and [[clinical psychology]].\n* ''[[Preventive medicine]]'' is the branch of medicine concerned with preventing disease.\n** ''[[Community health]]'' or ''[[public health]]'' is an aspect of health services concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on [[population health]] analysis.\n\n===Interdisciplinary fields=== &lt;!--Interdisciplinary sub-specialties of medicine redirects here--&gt;\nSome interdisciplinary sub-specialties of medicine include:\n* ''[[Aerospace medicine]]'' deals with medical problems related to flying and [[Human spaceflight|space travel]].\n* ''[[Addiction medicine]]'' deals with the treatment of addiction.\n* ''[[Medical ethics]]'' deals with [[ethic]]al and [[moral]] principles that apply values and judgments to the practice of medicine.\n* ''[[Biomedical Engineering]]'' is a field dealing with the application of [[engineering]] principles to medical practice.\n* ''[[Clinical pharmacology]]'' is concerned with how systems of [[therapeutics]] interact with patients.\n* ''[[Conservation medicine]]'' studies the relationship between human and animal health, and environmental conditions. Also known as ecological medicine, [[environmental medicine]], or [[medical geology]].\n* ''[[Disaster medicine]]'' deals with medical aspects of emergency preparedness, disaster mitigation and management.\n* ''[[Diving medicine]]'' (or [[hyperbaric medicine]]) is the prevention and treatment of diving-related problems.\n* ''[[Evolutionary medicine]]'' is a perspective on medicine derived through applying [[Evolution|evolutionary theory]].\n* ''[[Forensic medicine]]'' deals with medical questions in [[legal]] context, such as determination of the time and cause of death, type of weapon used to inflict trauma, reconstruction of the facial features using remains of deceased (skull) thus aiding identification.\n* ''[[Gender-based medicine]]'' studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease.\n* ''[[Hospice and Palliative Medicine]]'' is a relatively modern branch of clinical medicine that deals with pain and symptom relief and emotional support in patients with [[terminal illness]]es including cancer and [[heart failure]].\n* ''[[Hospital medicine]]'' is the general medical care of hospitalized patients. Physicians whose primary professional focus is hospital medicine are called [[hospitalist]]s in the United States and [[Canada]]. The term Most Responsible Physician (MRP) or attending physician is also used interchangeably to describe this role.\n* ''[[Laser medicine]]'' involves the use of lasers in the diagnostics or treatment of various conditions.\n* ''[[Medical humanities]]'' includes the [[humanities]] ([[literature]], [[philosophy]], [[ethics]], history and religion), [[social science]] ([[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]]), and the arts ([[literature]], theater, film, and [[visual arts]]) and their application to [[medical education]] and practice.\n* ''[[Health informatics]]'' is a relatively recent field that deal with the application of computers and [[information technology]] to medicine.\n* ''[[Nosology]]'' is the classification of diseases for various purposes.\n* ''[[Nosokinetics]]'' is the science/subject of measuring and modelling the process of care in health and social care systems.\n* ''[[Occupational medicine]]'' is the provision of health advice to organizations and individuals to ensure that the highest standards of health and safety at work can be achieved and maintained.\n* ''[[Pain management]]'' (also called ''[[pain medicine]]'', or ''algiatry'') is the medical discipline concerned with the relief of pain.\n* ''[[Pharmacogenomics]]'' is a form of ''individualized medicine''.\n* ''[[Podiatry|Podiatric medicine]]'' is the study of, diagnosis, and medical treatment of disorders of the foot, ankle, lower limb, hip and lower back.\n* ''[[Sexual medicine]]'' is concerned with diagnosing, assessing and treating all disorders related to sexuality.\n* ''[[Sports medicine]]'' deals with the treatment and prevention and rehabilitation of sports/exercise injuries such as [[muscle spasm]]s, [[muscle tear]]s, injuries to ligaments (ligament tears or ruptures) and their repair in [[sportsperson|athletes]], [[amateur]] and [[professional]].\n* ''[[Therapeutics]]'' is the field, more commonly referenced in earlier periods of history, of the various remedies that can be used to treat disease and promote health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106176?query=Therapeutics&amp;ct= |title=therapeutics (medicine) |website=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |access-date=21 Apr 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218085231/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106176?query=Therapeutics&amp;ct= |archive-date=18 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* ''[[Travel medicine]]'' or ''emporiatrics'' deals with health problems of international travelers or travelers across highly different environments.\n* ''[[Tropical medicine]]'' deals with the prevention and treatment of tropical diseases.

In some jurisdictions this function is combined with the emergency department.\n* [[Veterinary medicine]]; [[veterinarians]] apply similar techniques as physicians to the care of animals.\n* ''[[Wilderness medicine (practice)|Wilderness medicine]]'' entails the practice of medicine in the wild, where conventional medical facilities may not be available.\n* Many other [[health science]] fields, e.g. [[dietetics]]\n\n==Education and legal controls==\n{{Main|Medical education|Medical license}}\n[[File:Medical students learning about stitches (2760577402).jpg|thumb|Medical students learning about stitches]]\n\nMedical education and training varies around the world. It typically involves entry level education at a university [[medical school]], followed by a period of supervised practice or [[medical intern|internship]], or [[residency (medicine)|residency]]. This can be followed by postgraduate vocational training. A variety of teaching methods have been employed in medical education, still itself a focus of active research. In Canada and the United States of America, a [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree, often abbreviated M.D., or a [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] degree, often abbreviated as D.O. and unique to the United States, must be completed in and delivered from a recognized university.\n\nSince knowledge, techniques, and medical technology continue to evolve at a rapid rate, many regulatory authorities require [[continuing medical education]]. Medical practitioners upgrade their knowledge in various ways, including [[medical journal]]s, seminars, conferences, and online programs.  A database of objectives covering medical knowledge, as suggested by national societies across the United States, can be searched at http://data.medobjectives.marian.edu/.&lt;ref name=&quot;medObjectives&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brooks S, Biala N, Arbor S | title = A searchable database of medical education objectives - creating a comparable gold standard | journal = BMC Medical Education | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 31 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29499684 | pmc = 5833091 | doi = 10.1186/s12909-018-1136-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Madrid (RPS 13-07-2010) Organizaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Colegial de Espa\u00f1a, fachada.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Headquarters of the [[Organizaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Colegial de Espa\u00f1a]], which regulates the medical profession in Spain]]\nIn most countries, it is a legal requirement for a medical doctor to be licensed or registered. In general, this entails a medical degree from a university and accreditation by a medical board or an equivalent national organization, which may ask the applicant to pass exams. This restricts the considerable legal authority of the medical profession to physicians that are trained and qualified by national standards. It is also intended as an assurance to patients and as a safeguard against [[charlatan]]s that practice inadequate medicine for personal gain. While the laws generally require medical doctors to be trained in &quot;evidence based&quot;, Western, or [[Hippocratic]] Medicine, they are not intended to discourage different paradigms of health.\n\nIn the European Union, the profession of doctor of medicine is regulated. A profession is said to be regulated when access and exercise is subject to the possession of a specific professional qualification.\nThe regulated professions database contains a list of regulated professions for doctor of medicine in the EU member states, EEA countries and Switzerland. This list is covered by the Directive 2005/36/EC.\n\nDoctors who are negligent or intentionally harmful in their care of patients can face charges of [[medical malpractice]] and be subject to civil, criminal, or professional sanctions.\n\n==Medical ethics==\n{{main|Medical ethics}}\n[[File:HippocraticOath.jpg|thumb|upright|A 12th-century [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] manuscript of the [[Hippocratic Oath]]]]\nMedical ethics is a system of moral principles that apply values and judgments to the practice of medicine. As a scholarly discipline, medical ethics encompasses its practical application in clinical settings as well as work on its history, philosophy, theology, and sociology. Six of the values that commonly apply to medical ethics discussions are:\n* [[Autonomy#Medicine|autonomy]] \u2013 the patient has the right to refuse or choose their treatment. (''Voluntas aegroti suprema lex''.)\n* [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] \u2013 a practitioner should act in the best interest of the patient. (''Salus aegroti suprema lex''.)\n* [[Justice (ethics)|justice]] \u2013 concerns the distribution of scarce health resources, and the decision of who gets what treatment (fairness and equality).\n* [[Primum non nocere|non-maleficence]] \u2013 &quot;first, do no harm&quot; (''primum non-nocere'').\n* [[respect for persons]] \u2013 the patient (and the person treating the patient) have the right to be treated with dignity.\n* [[truth]]fulness and [[honesty]] \u2013 the concept of [[informed consent]] has increased in importance since the historical events of the [[Doctors' Trial]] of the Nuremberg trials, [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]], and others.\n\nValues such as these do not give answers as to how to handle a particular situation, but provide a useful framework for understanding conflicts. When moral values are in conflict, the result may be an ethical [[dilemma]] or crisis. Sometimes, no good solution to a dilemma in medical ethics exists, and occasionally, the values of the medical community (i.e., the hospital and its staff) conflict with the values of the individual patient, family, or larger non-medical community. Conflicts can also arise between health care providers, or among family members. For example, some argue that the principles of autonomy and beneficence clash when patients refuse [[blood transfusions]], considering them life-saving; and truth-telling was not emphasized to a large extent before the HIV era.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of medicine|Timeline of medicine and medical technology}}\n[[File:Imhotep-Louvre.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Statuette of ancient Egyptian physician [[Imhotep]], the first physician from antiquity known by name]]\n\n===Ancient world===\n[[Prehistoric medicine]] incorporated plants ([[herbalism]]), animal parts, and minerals. In many cases these materials were used ritually as magical substances by priests, [[shamans]], or [[medicine man|medicine men]]. Well-known spiritual systems include [[animism]] (the notion of inanimate objects having spirits), [[spiritualism]] (an appeal to gods or communion with ancestor spirits); [[shamanism]] (the vesting of an individual with mystic powers); and [[divination]] (magically obtaining the truth). The field of [[medical anthropology]] examines the ways in which culture and society are organized around or impacted by issues of health, health care and related issues.\n\nEarly records on medicine have been discovered from [[ancient Egyptian medicine]], [[Babylonian Medicine]], [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] medicine (in the [[Indian subcontinent]]), [[classical Chinese medicine]] (predecessor to the modern [[traditional Chinese medicine]]), and [[ancient Greek medicine]] and [[Medicine in ancient Rome|Roman medicine]].\n\nIn Egypt, [[Imhotep]] (3rd millennium BCE) is the first physician in history known by name. The oldest [[Egyptian medical papyri|Egyptian medical text]] is the ''[[Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus]]'' from around 2000 BCE, which describes gynaecological diseases. The ''[[Edwin Smith Papyrus]]'' dating back to 1600 BCE is an early work on surgery, while the ''[[Ebers Papyrus]]'' dating back to 1500 BCE is akin to a textbook on medicine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Acker&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Ackerknecht |first=Erwin | name-list-format = vanc |title=A Short History of Medicine |url= https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofme00acke |url-access=registration |year=1982 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-2726-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofme00acke/page/22 22] }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn China, archaeological evidence of medicine in Chinese dates back to the [[Bronze Age]] [[Shang Dynasty]], based on seeds for herbalism and tools presumed to have been used for surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hong |first=Francis | name-list-format = vanc |title=History of Medicine in China |journal=McGill Journal of Medicine |year=2004 |volume=8 |issue=1 |page=7984 |url=http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/MJM/issues/v08n01/crossroads/hong.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201231218/http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/MJM/issues/v08n01/crossroads/hong.pdf |archive-date=1 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Huangdi Neijing]]'', the progenitor of Chinese medicine, is a medical text written beginning in the 2nd century BCE and compiled in the 3rd century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unsc&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Unschuld|first=Pual | name-list-format = vanc |title=Huang Di Nei Jing: Nature, Knowledge, Imagery in an Ancient Chinese Medical Text|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N2ZdrPCbpNIC&amp;pg=PR9|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-92849-7|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn India, the surgeon [[Sushruta]] described numerous surgical operations, including the earliest forms of [[plastic surgery]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Singh&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Singh A, Sarangi D |year=2003|title=We need to think and act|journal=Indian Journal of Plastic Surgery|url=http://www.ijps.org/text.asp?2003/36/1/53/5785|volume= 36 |issue = 1|pages= 53\u201354}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=July 2010}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Longfellow&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rana RE, Arora BS | title = History of plastic surgery in India | journal = Journal of Postgraduate Medicine | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 76\u20138 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12082339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earliest records of dedicated hospitals come from Mihintale in [[Sri Lanka]] where evidence of dedicated medicinal treatment facilities for patients are found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aluvihare A | title = Rohal Kramaya Lovata Dhayadha Kale Sri Lankikayo. | journal = Vidhusara Science Magazine | date = November 1993 | pages = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Rannan-Eliya RP, De Mel N | title = Resource mobilization in Sri Lanka's health sector | work = Harvard School of Public Health &amp; Health Policy Programme, Institute of Policy Studies | date = 9 February 1997 | url = http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ihsg/publications/pdf/No-42.PDF | page = 19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[File:HSAsclepiusKos retouched.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Mosaic on the floor of the [[Asclepieion]] of Kos, depicting [[Hippocrates]], with [[Asklepius]] in the middle (2nd\u20133rd century)]]\nIn Greece, the [[Ancient Greek medicine|Greek physician]] [[Hippocrates]], the &quot;father of modern medicine&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18392218&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grammaticos PC, Diamantis A | title = Useful known and unknown views of the father of modern medicine, Hippocrates and his teacher Democritus | journal = Hellenic Journal of Nuclear Medicine | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 2\u20134 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18392218 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;blackwellpublishing.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/eccmid16/abstract.asp?id=50854 The father of modern medicine: the first research of the physical factor of tetanus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118132902/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/eccmid16/abstract.asp?id=50854 |date=18 November 2011 }}, European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases&lt;/ref&gt; laid the foundation for a rational approach to medicine.

It supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor. This welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and possessing large farmlands and estates. The [[Benedictine]] order was noted for setting up hospitals and infirmaries in their monasteries, growing medical herbs and becoming the chief medical care givers of their districts, as at the great [[Abbey of Cluny]]. The Church also established a network of [[cathedral schools]] and universities where medicine was studied. The [[Schola Medica Salernitana]] in Salerno, looking to the learning of [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Arab]] physicians, grew to be the finest medical school in Medieval Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Blainey | first = Geoffrey | name-list-format = vanc |year=2011 |title=A Short History of Christianity |publisher=Penguin Viking |pages=214\u2013215 |oclc=793902685 |title-link=A Short History of Christianity }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:SantaMariaDellaScalaSienaBack.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Siena's [[Santa Maria della Scala (Siena)|Santa Maria della Scala Hospital]], one of Europe's oldest hospitals. During the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church established universities to revive the study of sciences, drawing on the learning of Greek and Arab physicians in the study of medicine.]]\n\nHowever, the fourteenth and fifteenth century [[Black Death]] devastated both the Middle East and Europe, and it has even been argued that Western Europe was generally more effective in recovering from the pandemic than the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dols has shown that the Black Death was much more commonly believed by European authorities than by Middle Eastern authorities to be contagious; as a result, flight was more commonly counseled, and in urban Italy quarantines were organized on a much wider level than in urban Egypt or Syria ({{cite book | first = Michael W. | last = Dols | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Black Death in the Middle East |publisher=Princeton |year=1977 |pages=119, 285\u2013290 |oclc=2296964 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; In the early modern period, important early figures in medicine and anatomy emerged in Europe, including [[Gabriele Falloppio]] and [[William Harvey]].\n\nThe major shift in medical thinking was the gradual rejection, especially during the [[Black Death]] in the 14th and 15th centuries, of what may be called the 'traditional authority' approach to science and medicine. This was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so, then that was the way it was, and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly (which was paralleled by a similar shift in European society in general \u2013 see [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]]'s rejection of [[Ptolemy]]'s theories on astronomy). Physicians like [[Vesalius]] improved upon or disproved some of the theories from the past. The main tomes used both by medicine students and expert physicians were [[Materia Medica]] and [[Pharmacopoeia]].\n\n[[Andreas Vesalius]] was the author of ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'', an important book on [[human anatomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/books.htm |title=Page through a virtual copy of Vesalius's ''De Humanis Corporis Fabrica'' |publisher=Archive.nlm.nih.gov |access-date=21 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteria and microorganisms were first observed with a microscope by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] in 1676, initiating the scientific field [[microbiology]].&lt;ref name=Brock&gt;{{cite book |veditors= Madigan M, Martinko J | title = Brock Biology of Microorganisms | edition = 11th | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-13-144329-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Independently from [[Ibn al-Nafis]], [[Michael Servetus]] rediscovered the [[pulmonary circulation]], but this discovery did not reach the public because it was written down for the first time in the &quot;Manuscript of Paris&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelservetusresearch.com/ENGLISH/works.html Michael Servetus Research] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113223851/http://www.michaelservetusresearch.com/ENGLISH/works.html |date=13 November 2012 }} Website with a graphical study on the Manuscript of Paris by Servetus&lt;/ref&gt; in 1546, and later published in the theological work for which he paid with his life in 1553.

Before this, medical doctors treated both humans and other animals.\n\nModern scientific [[biomedical research]] (where results are testable and [[reproducible]]) began to replace early Western traditions based on herbalism, the Greek &quot;[[humorism|four humours]]&quot; and other such pre-modern notions. The modern era really began with [[Edward Jenner]]'s discovery of the [[smallpox vaccine]] at the end of the 18th century (inspired by the method of [[inoculation]] earlier practiced in Asia), [[Robert Koch]]'s discoveries around 1880 of the transmission of disease by bacteria, and then the discovery of [[antibiotic]]s around 1900.\n\nThe post-18th century [[modernity]] period brought more groundbreaking researchers from Europe. From [[Germany]] and Austria, doctors [[Rudolf Virchow]], [[Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgen]], [[Karl Landsteiner]] and [[Otto Loewi]] made notable contributions. In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Alexander Fleming]], [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], [[Francis Crick]] and [[Florence Nightingale]] are considered important. [[Spain|Spanish]] doctor [[Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal]] is considered the father of modern [[neuroscience]].\n\nFrom New Zealand and Australia came [[Maurice Wilkins]], [[Howard Florey]], and [[Frank Macfarlane Burnet]].\n\nOthers that did significant work include [[William Williams Keen]], [[William Coley]], [[James D.

The movement is facilitated by modern global [[information science]], which allows as much of the available evidence as possible to be collected and analyzed according to standard protocols that are then disseminated to healthcare providers.

Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.&lt;ref name=&quot;What does nature mean&quot;/&gt;\n\nThe word ''nature'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''natura'', or &quot;essential qualities, innate disposition&quot;, and in ancient times, literally meant &quot;birth&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;etymonline-nature&quot;&gt;{{OEtymD|nature|accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient philosophy, ''Natura'' is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word ''[[physis]]'' (\u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.&lt;ref&gt;An account of the pre-Socratic use of the concept of \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 may be found in Naddaf, Gerard (2006) ''The Greek Concept of Nature'', SUNY Press, and in {{cite journal |last1=Ducarme |first1=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric |last2=Couvet |first2=Denis |year=2020 |title=What does 'nature' mean? |journal=[[Palgrave Communications]] |volume=6 |issue=14 |publisher=[[Springer Nature]] |pages= |doi=10.1057/s41599-020-0390-y |doi-access=free }}. The word \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, while first used in connection with a plant in Homer, occurs early in Greek philosophy, and in several senses. Generally, these senses match rather well the current senses in which the English word ''nature'' is used, as confirmed by Guthrie, W.K.C. ''Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'' (volume 2 of his ''History of Greek Philosophy''), Cambridge UP, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first known use of ''physis'' was by [[Homer]] in reference to the intrinsic qualities of a plant: \u1f63\u03c2 \u1f04\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03b5 \u03c6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03ca\u03c6\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f10\u03ba \u03b3\u03b1\u03af\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c1\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2, \u03ba\u03b1\u03af \u03bc\u03bf\u03b9 '''\u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd''' \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f14\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03be\u03b5.

During the advent of modern [[scientific method]] in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton's [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] (1687), for example, is translated &quot;Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy&quot;, and reflects the then-current use of the words &quot;[[natural philosophy]]&quot;, akin to &quot;systematic study of nature&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The etymology of the word &quot;physical&quot; shows its use as a synonym for &quot;natural&quot; in about the mid-15th century: {{OEtymD|physical|accessdate=September 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Industrial revolution]], nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention : it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions ([[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], American [[transcendentalism]]) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history ([[Hegel]], [[Marx]]). However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the presocratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;What does nature mean&quot;/&gt;\n\nWithin the various uses of the word today, &quot;nature&quot; often refers to geology and [[wildlife]]. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects\u2014the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the [[Earth]]. It is often taken to mean the &quot;[[natural environment]]&quot; or [[wilderness]]\u2014wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, &quot;human nature&quot; or &quot;the whole of nature&quot;. This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human [[consciousness]] or a human [[mind]]. Depending on the particular context, the term &quot;natural&quot; might also be distinguished from the [[Wikt:unnatural|unnatural]] or the [[supernatural]].&lt;ref name=&quot;What does nature mean&quot;/&gt;\n\n==Earth==\n{{Nature timeline}}\n{{Main|Earth|Earth science}}\n[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|left|View of the [[Earth]], taken in 1972 by the crew of [[Apollo 17]]]]\nEarth is the only [[planet]] known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research.

The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and an iron-filled core that generates a [[magnetic field]].

The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, [[structural geology|structure]], [[Physical property|physical properties]], dynamics, and [[History of the Earth|history]] of [[Earth materials]], and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major [[academic discipline]], and is also important for [[mining|mineral]] and [[petroleum geology|hydrocarbon]] extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of [[natural hazard]]s, some [[Geotechnical engineering]] fields, and understanding [[Paleoclimatology|past climates]] and environments.\n\n====Geological evolution====\n[[File:Tectonic plate boundaries.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Three types of geological [[plate tectonic]] boundaries]]\nThe geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.\n\nRock units are first emplaced either by [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] onto the surface or intrude into the [[Country rock (geology)|overlying rock]]. Deposition can occur when [[sediment]]s settle onto the surface of the Earth and later [[lithification|lithify]] into [[sedimentary rock]], or when as [[volcanic rock|volcanic material]] such as [[volcanic ash]] or [[lava]] flows, blanket the surface. Igneous [[intrusion]]s such as [[batholith]]s, [[laccolith]]s, [[dike (geology)|dikes]], and [[sill (geology)|sills]], push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.\n\nAfter the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be [[deformation (mechanics)|deformed]] and/or [[metamorphism|metamorphosed]]. Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, [[extension (geology)|horizontal extension]], or side-to-side ([[strike-slip]]) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], [[divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], and [[transform boundary|transform boundaries]], respectively, between [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]].\n\n===Historical perspective===\n{{Main|History of the Earth|Evolution}}\n[[File:Pangea animation 03.gif|thumb|300px|An animation showing the movement of the continents from the separation of [[Pangaea]] until the present day]]\n&lt;!-- Images End --&gt;\nEarth is estimated to have formed 4.54&amp;nbsp;billion years ago from the [[solar nebula]], along with the [[Sun]] and other [[planet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=G.

The [[ozone layer]] plays an important role in depleting the amount of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As [[DNA]] is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.\n\nTerrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the [[troposphere|lower part of the atmosphere]], and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AJ4SnHbb-ZcC&amp;pg=PA42|title=Environmental Science: Problems, Connections and Solutions|last=Miller|last2=Spoolman|first2=Scott|date=September 28, 2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-38337-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ocean current]]s are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater [[thermohaline circulation]] which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the [[polar region]]s much colder.\n[[File:Lightnings sequence 2 animation-wcag.gif|thumb|left|[[Lightning]]]]\nWeather can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Extremes in weather, such as [[tornado]]es or [[hurricane]]s and [[cyclone]]s, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation. Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.\n\nClimate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather. Various factors are known to [[Climate variability and change|influence the climate]], including ocean currents, surface [[albedo]], [[greenhouse gas]]es, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit. Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including [[ice age]]s.\n[[File:Dszpics1.jpg|thumb|A tornado in central [[Oklahoma]]]]\nThe climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially [[latitude]]. A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the [[tropical climate]] at the equator to the [[polar climate]] in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the [[Earth]]'s [[axis of rotation|axis]] being [[axial tilt|tilted]] relative to its [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]. Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the [[sun]]. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the [[northern hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere|southern]] hemispheres experience opposite seasons.\n\nWeather is a [[Chaos theory|chaotic system]] that is readily modified by small changes to the [[Natural environment|environment]], so accurate [[Meteorology|weather forecasting]] is limited to only a few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stern|first=Harvey|last2=Davidson|first2=Noel|date=May 25, 2015|title=Trends in the skill of weather prediction at lead times of 1\u201314 days|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|volume=141|issue=692|pages=2726\u201336|doi=10.1002/qj.2559|bibcode=2015QJRMS.141.2726S|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/62ca56d2059df0737e83f2ba1b24922dd2fd0243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tropical Ocean Warming Drives Recent Northern Hemisphere Climate Change|website=Science Daily|date=April 6, 2001|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/04/010406073554.htm|accessdate=May 24, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421222313/http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/04/010406073554.htm|archive-date=April 21, 2006|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Water on the Earth==\n[[File:44 - Iguazu - D\u00e9cembre 2007.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Iguazu Falls]] on the border between [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]]]\n{{Main|Water}}\n'''Water''' is a [[chemical substance]] that is composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] (H2O) and is vital for all known forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/background.html |title=Water for Life |publisher=Un.org |date=March 22, 2005 |accessdate=May 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514200432/http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/background.html |archive-date=May 14, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In typical usage, ''water'' refers only to its liquid form or [[States of matter|state]], but the substance also has a solid state, [[ice]], and a [[gas]]eous state, [[water vapor]], or [[steam]]. &lt;!--About 1.460 [[Tonne#Multiples|petatonnes]]&amp;nbsp;(Pt) (10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kilograms) of water--&gt;Water covers 71% of the [[Earth]]'s surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Geo|title=World|work=CIA \u2013 World Fact Book|accessdate=December 20, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105171656/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Geo|archive-date=January 5, 2010|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in [[aquifer]]s and 0.001% in the [[atmosphere|air]] as [[vapor]], clouds, and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070320034158/http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html Water Vapor in the Climate System], Special Report, American Geophysical Union, December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080220070111/http://www.unep.org/dewa/assessments/ecosystems/water/vitalwater/ Vital Water].

Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, [[rift zone]]s, and areas with ongoing or recent [[glacier|glaciation]]. Other lakes are found in [[endorheic basin]]s or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last [[Ice Age]]. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.\n\n====Ponds====\n[[File:Mill Pond Sunset.jpg|thumb|The Westborough Reservoir (Mill Pond) in [[Westborough, Massachusetts]]]]\n{{Main|Pond}}\nA '''pond''' is a [[body of water|body]] of [[Water stagnation|standing water]], either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including [[water garden]]s designed for aesthetic ornamentation, [[fish pond]]s designed for commercial fish breeding, and [[solar pond]]s designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via [[current (stream)|current]] speed.

Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is ''Burn'' in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/faqs.htm USGS \u2013 U.S. Geological Survey \u2013 FAQs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701155523/http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/faqs.htm |date=July 1, 2015 }}, No. 17 What is the difference between mountain, hill, and [[Summit (topography)|peak]]; lake and pond; or river and [[stream|creek]]?&lt;/ref&gt; A river is part of the [[hydrological cycle]].

In [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' system, these became the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] [[Vegetabilia]] (later [[Plantae]]) and [[Animal]]ia. Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the [[fungus|fungi]] and several groups of [[alga]]e were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts.

People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and [[terrain]].\n\nRegional floras commonly are divided into categories such as ''native flora'' and ''agricultural and garden flora'', the lastly mentioned of which are intentionally grown and cultivated. Some types of &quot;native flora&quot; actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced. This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature.\n\nAnother category of plant has historically been carved out for ''weeds''. Though the term has fallen into disfavor among [[botanist]]s as a formal way to categorize &quot;useless&quot; plants, the informal use of the word &quot;weeds&quot; to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature. Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as ''domestic'', ''farm animals'', ''wild animals'', ''pests'', etc. according to their relationship to human life.\n\nAnimals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] and usually [[multicellular]] (although see [[Myxozoa]]), which separates them from bacteria, [[archaea]], and most [[protist]]s. They are [[heterotroph]]ic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and [[alga]]e. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and [[fungus|fungi]] by lacking [[cell wall]]s.\n\nWith a few exceptions\u2014most notably the two [[Phylum|phyla]] consisting of [[sponge]]s and [[placozoa]]ns\u2014animals have bodies that are differentiated into [[biological tissue|tissues]]. These include [[muscle]]s, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a [[nervous system]], which sends and processes signals. There is also typically an internal [[digestion|digestive]] chamber. The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of [[collagen]] and elastic [[glycoprotein]]s. This may be calcified to form structures like [[Animal shell|shells]], [[bone]]s, and [[spicule (sponge)|spicules]], a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.\n\n==Human interrelationship==\n{{Human timeline}}\n[[File:Na Pali Coast - Kauai.jpg|thumb|left|Despite their natural beauty, the secluded valleys along the [[Na Pali Coast]] in Hawaii are heavily modified by introduced [[invasive species]] such as [[She-oak]]]]\nAlthough [[humans]] comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living [[biomass]] on Earth, the [[human impact on the environment|human effect on nature]] is disproportionately large. Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and &quot;made environments&quot; is not clear cut except at the extremes. Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace.\n\nThe development of [[technology]] by the human race has allowed the greater [[exploitation of natural resources]] and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from [[natural hazards]]. In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human [[civilization]] remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex [[feedback loop]] between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feedback Loops in Global Climate Change Point to a Very Hot 21st Century|website=Science Daily|date=May 22, 2006|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/ESD-feedback-loops.html|accessdate=January 7, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208131415/http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/ESD-feedback-loops.html|archive-date=December 8, 2006|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, [[deforestation]], and disasters such as oil spills.

That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called [[aesthetics]]. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |title=On the Beauty of Nature |publisher=The Wilderness Society |accessdate=September 29, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909220214/http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |archivedate=September 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of [[landscape art]] began in China during the [[Tang Dynasty art|Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907). The tradition of representing nature ''as it is'' became one of the aims of [[Chinese painting]] and was a significant influence in Asian art.\n\nAlthough natural wonders are celebrated in the [[Psalms]] and the [[Book of Job]], [[wilderness]] portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially in the works of the [[Romantic movement]]. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] artists [[John Constable]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. [[William Wordsworth]]'s poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.spacesfornature.org/greatspaces/conservation.html History of Conservation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708005819/http://www.spacesfornature.org/greatspaces/conservation.html |date=July 8, 2006 }} BC Spaces for Nature.

A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word [[mimesis]], the imitation of nature. Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical [[Substantial form|forms]] and more generally by [[patterns in nature]]. As David Rothenburg writes, &quot;The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Survival of the Beautiful: Art, Science and Evolution | publisher=Bloomsbury | author=Rothenberg, David | isbn=978-1-60819-216-8 | date=2011 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/survivalofbeauti0000roth }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|281}}\n\n==Matter and energy==\n[[File:Hydrogen Density Plots.png|thumb|The first few [[hydrogen atom]] [[Atomic orbital|electron orbitals]] shown as cross-sections with color-coded probability density]]\n{{Main|Matter|Energy}}\nSome fields of science see nature as matter in motion, obeying certain laws of nature which science seeks to understand.

Many activities in [[entertainment]] are work for one person and recreation for another. Over time, a recreational activity may become work, and vice versa. Thus, for a musician, playing an instrument may be at one time a profession, and at another a recreation. \n\nSimilarly, it may be difficult to separate education from recreation as in the case of [[recreational mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;Kulkarni, D.

The interplay between faith and reason, and their use as perceived support for religious beliefs, have been a subject of interest to philosophers and theologians.&lt;ref name=&quot;iep.utm.edu&quot;/&gt; The origin of religious belief as such is an open question, with possible explanations including awareness of individual death, a sense of community, and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Zeigler |first=David |date=January-February 2020 |title=Religious Belief from Dreams? |magazine=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |location=Amherst, N.Y. |publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]] |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=51\u201354}}&lt;/ref&gt; \n\n====Mythology====\n{{Main|Mythology}}\nThe word ''myth'' has several meanings.\n# A traditional story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomenon;\n# A person or thing having only an imaginary or unverifiable existence; or\n# A metaphor for the spiritual potentiality in the human being.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell, ''The Power of Myth'', p. 22 {{ISBN|0-385-24774-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAncient [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religions, such as those of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and [[Scandinavia]], are usually categorized under the heading of [[mythology]]. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or [[culture]]s in development, are similarly called myths in the [[anthropology of religion]]. The term myth can be used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. By defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real or true than one's own religious stories and beliefs. [[Joseph Campbell]] remarked, &quot;Mythology is often thought of as ''other people's'' religions, and religion can be defined as mis-interpreted mythology.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell, ''Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor''. Ed. Eugene Kennedy. New World Library {{ISBN|1-57731-202-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn sociology, however, the term myth has a non-pejorative meaning. There, myth is defined as a story that is important for the group whether or not it is objectively or provably true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/myth|title=myth|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[resurrection]] of their real-life founder [[Jesus]], which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, is symbolic of the power of life over death, and is also said to be a historical event. But from a mythological outlook, whether or not the event actually occurred is unimportant. Instead, the [[symbol]]ism of the death of an old life and the start of a new life is what is most significant. Religious believers may or may not accept such symbolic interpretations.\n\n===Practices===\n{{Main|Religious behaviour|Cult (religious practice)}}\nThe practices of a religion may include [[ritual]]s, [[sermon]]s, commemoration or veneration (of a [[deity]], [[God (male deity)|gods]], or [[goddess]]es), [[sacrifice]]s, [[festival]]s, [[Banquet|feasts]], [[trance]]s, [[initiation]]s, [[funeral|funerary services]], [[matrimony|matrimonial services]], [[meditation]], [[prayer]], [[religious music]], [[religious art]], [[sacred dance]], [[Community service|public service]], or other aspects of human culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;OD&quot;&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/mythology Oxford Dictionaries] mythology, retrieved 9 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Social organisation===\nReligions have a societal basis, either as a living tradition which is carried by lay participants, or with an organized [[clergy]], and a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership.\n\n==Academic study==\n{{Main|Religious studies|Classifications of religious movements}}\nA number of disciplines study the phenomenon of religion: [[theology]], [[comparative religion]], [[history of religion]], [[evolutionary origin of religions]], [[anthropology of religion]], [[psychology of religion]] (including [[neurotheology|neuroscience of religion]] and [[evolutionary psychology of religion]]), [[law and religion]], and [[sociology of religion]].\n\nDaniel L. Pals mentions eight classical theories of religion, focusing on various aspects of religion: [[animism]] and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], by [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.B. Tylor]] and [[J.G. Frazer]]; the [[Psychoanalysis|psycho-analytic]] approach of [[Sigmund Freud]]; and further [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[E.E. Evans-Pritchard]], and [[Clifford Geertz]].{{sfn|Pals|2006}}\n\n[[Michael Stausberg]] gives an overview of contemporary theories of religion, including [[Cognitive science of religion|cognitive]] and biological approaches.{{sfn|Stausberg|2009}}\n\n===Theories===\n{{Main|Theories of religion}}\n[[Sociology of religion|Sociological]] and [[Anthropology of religion|anthropological]] theories of religion generally attempt to explain the [[origin of religion|origin]] and [[social function|function of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segal|2005|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories define what they present as universal characteristics of [[religious belief]] and [[Religious behaviour|practice]].\n\n====Origins and development====\n{{Main|History of religion}}\n[[File:Yazilikaya B 12erGruppe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Yaz\u0131l\u0131kaya]] sanctuary in [[Turkey]], with the twelve gods of the underworld]]\nThe origin of religion is uncertain. There are a number of theories regarding the subsequent origins of religious practices.\n\nAccording to [[anthropologists]] John Monaghan and Peter Just, &quot;Many of the great world religions appear to have begun as revitalization movements of some sort, as the vision of a charismatic prophet fires the imaginations of people seeking a more comprehensive answer to their problems than they feel is provided by everyday beliefs. Charismatic individuals have emerged at many times and places in the world. It seems that the key to long-term success\u2014and many movements come and go with little long-term effect\u2014has relatively little to do with the prophets, who appear with surprising regularity, but more to do with the development of a group of supporters who are able to institutionalize the movement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social &amp; Cultural Anthropology |url=https://archive.org/details/socialculturalan00mona |url-access=limited |last1=Monaghan |first1=John |last2=Just |first2=Peter |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-285346-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/socialculturalan00mona/page/n136 126]}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe [[development of religion]] has taken different forms in different cultures. Some religions place an emphasis on belief, while others emphasize practice. Some religions focus on the subjective experience of the religious individual, while others consider the activities of the religious community to be most important. Some religions claim to be universal, believing their [[law]]s and [[cosmology]] to be binding for everyone, while others are intended to be practiced only by a closely defined or localized group. In many places, religion has been associated with public institutions such as [[education]], [[hospital]]s, the [[family]], [[government]], and [[politics|political]] hierarchies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |title=Social &amp; Cultural Anthropology |url=https://archive.org/details/socialculturalan00mona |url-access=limited |last1=Monaghan |first1=John |last2=Just |first2=Peter |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-285346-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/socialculturalan00mona/page/n134 124]}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAnthropologists John Monoghan and Peter Just state that, &quot;it seems apparent that one thing religion or belief helps us do is deal with problems of human life that are significant, persistent, and intolerable. One important way in which religious beliefs accomplish this is by providing a set of ideas about how and why the world is put together that allows people to accommodate anxieties and deal with misfortune.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;\n\n====Cultural system====\nWhile religion is difficult to define, one standard model of religion, used in [[religious studies]] courses, was proposed by [[Clifford Geertz]], who simply called it a &quot;cultural system&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Geertz, ''Religion as a Cultural System'', 1973&lt;/ref&gt; A critique of Geertz's model by [[Talal Asad]] categorized religion as &quot;an [[anthropology|anthropological]] category&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Talal Asad, ''The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category'', 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Niebuhr's (1894\u20131962) five-fold classification of the relationship between Christ and culture, however, indicates that religion and culture can be seen as two separate systems, though not without some interplay.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Niebuhr, ''Christ and Culture'' (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1951) as cited by Domenic Marbaniang, &quot;The Gospel and Culture: Areas of Conflict, Consent, and Conversion&quot;, ''Journal of Contemporary Christian'' Vol. 6, No. 1 (Bangalore: CFCC, Aug 2014), {{ISSN|2231-5233}} pp. 9\u201310&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====Social constructionism====\n{{Main|Theories about religions#Social constructionism|l1=Social constructionism}}\nOne modern academic theory of religion, [[social constructionism]], says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all [[spirituality|spiritual]] practice and [[worship]] follows a model similar to the [[Abrahamic religions]] as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings.&lt;ref name=&quot;vergote 89&quot;&gt;Vergote, Antoine, ''Religion, belief and unbelief: a psychological study'', Leuven University Press, 1997, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Daniel Dubuisson, Timothy Fitzgerald, Talal Asad, and Jason \u0100nanda Josephson. The social constructionists argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures.\n\n====Cognitive science====\n{{Main|Cognitive science of religion}}\n\nCognitive science of religion is the study of religious thought and behavior from the perspective of the cognitive and evolutionary sciences. The field employs methods and theories from a very broad range of disciplines, including: [[cognitive psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[cognitive anthropology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[neurobiology]], [[zoology]], and [[ethology]].  Scholars in this field seek to explain how human minds acquire, generate, and transmit religious thoughts, practices, and schemas by means of ordinary cognitive capacities.\n\nHallucinations and delusions related to religious content occurs in about 60% of people with [[schizophrenia]]. While this number varies across cultures, this had led to theories about a number of influential religious phenomenon and possible relation to psychotic disorders. A number of prophetic experiences are consistent with psychotic symptoms, although retrospective diagnoses are practically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=PT|title=Psychosis and paroxysmal visions in the lives of the founders of world religions.|journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=26|issue=1|date=2014|pages=E13\u201314|doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.12120412|pmid=24515692}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=ED|last2=Cunningham|first2=MG|last3=Price|first3=BH|title=The role of psychotic disorders in religious history considered.|journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=24|issue=4|date=2012|pages=410\u2013426|doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214|pmid=23224447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weber|first1=SR|last2=Pargament|first2=KI|title=The role of religion and spirituality in mental health.|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=September 2014|volume=27|issue=5|pages=358\u2013363|doi=10.1097/YCO.0000000000000080|pmid=25046080|s2cid=9075314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schizophrenic episodes are also experienced by people who do not have belief in gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reina|first1=Aaron|title=Faith Within Atheism|journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin|date=July 2014|volume=40|issue=4|pages=719\u2013720|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbt076|pmid=23760918|pmc=4059423}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nReligious content is also common in [[temporal lobe epilepsy]], and [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Favazza|first1=A|editor1-last=Sadock|editor1-first=B|editor2-last=Sadock|editor2-first=V|editor3-last=Ruiz|editor3-first=P|title=Kaplan and Sadocks Comprehensive Texbook of Psychiatry|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|edition=10th|chapter=Psychiatry and Spirituality}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altschuler|first1=EL|title=Temporal lobe epilepsy in the priestly source of the Pentateuch|journal=South African Medical Journal|date=2004|volume=11|issue=94|page=870|pmid=15587438}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheistic content is also found to be common with temporal lobe epilepsy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heilman&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heilman|first1=Kenneth M.|last2=Valenstein|first2=Edward |title=Clinical Neuropsychology|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=978-0-19-538487-1|page=488|quote=Studies that claim to show no difference in emotional makeup between temporal lobe and other epileptic patients (Guerrant et. al., 1962; Stevens, 1966) have been reinterpreted (Blumer, 1975) to indicate that there is, in fact, a difference: those with temporal lobe epilepsy are more likely to have more serious forms of emotional disturbance. This typical personality of temporal lobe epileptic patient has been described in roughly similar terms over many years (Blumer &amp; Benson, 1975; Geschwind, 1975, 1977; Blumer, 1999; Devinsky &amp; Schachter, 2009). These patients are said to have a deepening of emotions; they ascribe great significance to commonplace events. This can be manifested as a tendency to take a cosmic view; hyperreligiosity (or intensely professed atheism) is said to be common.}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Comparativism===\n{{Main|Comparative religion}}\nComparative religion is the branch of the [[study of religions]] concerned with the systematic comparison of the doctrines and practices of the world's religions. In general, the comparative study of religion yields a deeper understanding of the fundamental philosophical concerns of religion such as [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], and the nature and form of [[salvation]]. Studying such material is meant to give one a richer and more sophisticated understanding of human beliefs and practices regarding the [[sacred]], [[numinous]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[Divinity|divine]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Human beings' relation to that which they regard as holy, sacred, spiritual, and divine&quot; [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] (online, 2006), cited after {{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/religion/quotes.htm |title=Definitions of Religion |website=Religion facts}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot; /&gt; of the [[Major religious groups|main world religions]] includes [[Middle Eastern religions]] (including [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Iranian religions]]), [[Indian religions]], [[East Asian religions]], African religions, American religions, Oceanic religions, and classical Hellenistic religions.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497215/classification-of-religions/38029/Normative Charles Joseph Adams, ''Classification of religions: geographical'', Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Classification==\n{{Main||History of religion}}\n[[File:Prevailing world religions map.png|thumb|upright=2.05|A map of [[List of religious populations|major denominations and religions of the world]]]]\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, the academic practice of [[comparative religion]] divided religious belief into philosophically defined categories called world religions. Some academics [[Study of religion|studying the subject]] have divided religions into three broad categories:\n# [[world religions]], a term which refers to [[Transculturation|transcultural]], international religions;\n# [[indigenous religions]], which refers to smaller, culture-specific or nation-specific religious groups; and\n# [[new religious movements]], which refers to recently developed religions.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Graham (2000). ''Indigenous Religions: A Companion''. (Ed: Graham Harvey). London and New York: Cassell. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSome recent scholarship has argued that not all types of religion are necessarily separated by mutually exclusive philosophies, and furthermore that the utility of ascribing a practice to a certain philosophy, or even calling a given practice religious, rather than cultural, political, or social in nature, is limited.&lt;ref name=&quot;pennington&quot;&gt;Brian Kemble Pennington ''Was Hinduism Invented?''

It develops [[theory|theories]] of the world which best fit physically observed evidence.

Notably, most Muslim-majority countries adopt various aspects of [[sharia]], the Islamic law. Some countries even define themselves in religious terms, such as [[Iran|The Islamic Republic of Iran]]. The sharia thus affects up to 23% of the global population, or 1.57&amp;nbsp;billion people who are [[Muslim world|Muslims]].

In Asia, the role of religion differs widely between countries.

Matthew 23:16\u201322&quot; (para. #2111)\n\n===Agnosticism and atheism===\n{{Main|Atheism|Agnosticism|Irreligion|Antireligion|Humanism}}\n{{See also|Criticism of atheism}}\nThe terms [[atheist]] (lack of belief in any gods) and agnostic (belief in the unknowability of the existence of gods), though specifically contrary to theistic (e.g. Christian, Jewish, and Muslim) religious teachings, do not by definition mean the opposite of religious. There are religions (including Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism), in fact, that classify some of their followers as agnostic, atheistic, or [[nontheism|nontheistic]]. The true opposite of religious is the word irreligious. [[Irreligion]] describes an absence of any religion; [[antireligion]] describes an active opposition or aversion toward religions in general.\n\n===Interfaith cooperation===\n{{Main|Interfaith dialogue}}\nBecause religion continues to be recognized in Western thought as a universal impulse,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Structure of Religion in the U.S. {{!}} Boundless Sociology|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-sociology/chapter/the-structure-of-religion-in-the-u-s/|access-date=2020-08-08|website=courses.lumenlearning.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; many religious practitioners{{who|date=July 2016}} have aimed to band together in [[interfaith]] dialogue, cooperation, and [[Religion and peacebuilding|religious peacebuilding]].

[[Paul Tillich]] looked at religion as the soul of culture and culture as the form or framework of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Edward L. Queen, ''Encyclopedia of American Religious History, Volume 1'' Facts on File, 1996. p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; In his own words:\n&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion as ultimate concern is the meaning-giving substance of culture, and culture is the totality of forms in which the basic concern of religion expresses itself. In abbreviation: religion is the substance of culture, culture is the form of religion. Such a consideration definitely prevents the establishment of a dualism of religion and culture. Every religious act, not only in organized religion, but also in the most intimate movement of the soul, is culturally formed.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tillich, ''Theology of Culture'', Robert C. Kimball (ed), (Oxford University Press, 1959). p.42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n[[Ernst Troeltsch]], similarly, looked at culture as the soil of religion and thought that, therefore, transplanting a religion from its original culture to a foreign culture would actually kill it in the same manner that transplanting a plant from its natural soil to an alien soil would kill it.&lt;ref&gt;Eric J.

Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as &quot;all people living in a country&quot; or &quot;every atom composing a crystal&quot;. Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of [[statistical survey|surveys]] and [[experimental design|experiments]].&lt;ref name=Dodge&gt;Dodge, Y. (2006) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', Oxford University Press. {{isbn|0-19-920613-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[glossary of probability and statistics]].\n\nWhen [[census]] data cannot be collected, [[statistician]]s collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey [[sample (statistics)|samples]]. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole. An [[experimental study]] involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an [[observational study]] does not involve experimental manipulation.\n\nTwo main statistical methods are used in [[data analysis]]: [[descriptive statistics]], which summarize data from a sample using [[Index (statistics)|indexes]] such as the [[mean]] or [[standard deviation]], and [[statistical inference|inferential statistics]], which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation).&lt;ref name=LundResearchLtd&gt;{{cite web|last=Lund Research Ltd. |url=https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/descriptive-inferential-statistics.php |title=Descriptive and Inferential Statistics |publisher=statistics.laerd.com |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a ''distribution'' (sample or population): ''[[central tendency]]'' (or ''location'') seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while ''[[statistical dispersion|dispersion]]'' (or ''variability'') characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. Inferences on [[mathematical statistics]] are made under the framework of [[probability theory]], which deals with the analysis of random phenomena.\n\nA standard statistical procedure involves the collection of data leading to [[statistical hypothesis testing|test of the relationship]] between two statistical data sets, or a data set and synthetic data drawn from an idealized model. A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets, and this is compared as an [[alternative hypothesis|alternative]] to an idealized [[null hypothesis]] of no relationship between two data sets. Rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis is done using statistical tests that quantify the sense in which the null can be proven false, given the data that are used in the test. Working from a null hypothesis, two basic forms of error are recognized: [[Type I error]]s (null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a &quot;false positive&quot;) and [[Type II error]]s (null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual relationship between populations is missed giving a &quot;false negative&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Is the Difference Between Type I and Type II Hypothesis Testing Errors?|url = http://statistics.about.com/od/Inferential-Statistics/a/Type-I-And-Type-II-Errors.htm|website = About.com Education|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework: ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nMeasurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error. Many of these errors are classified as random (noise) or systematic ([[Bias (statistics)|bias]]), but other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also occur. The presence of [[missing data]] or [[censoring (statistics)|censoring]] may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems.\n\nThe earliest writings on [[probability]] and statistics, statistical methods drawing from [[probability theory]], date back to [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab mathematicians]] and [[cryptographers]], notably [[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi|Al-Khalil]] (717\u2013786)&lt;ref name=&quot;LB&quot;/&gt; and [[Al-Kindi]] (801\u2013873).&lt;ref name=sim2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=ibr1992/&gt; In the 18th century, statistics also started to draw heavily from [[calculus]]. In more recent years statistics has relied more on statistical software to produce these tests such as descriptive analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.answers.org.za/index.php/tutorials|title= How to Calculate Descriptive Statistics|publisher=Answers Consulting|date=2018-02-03|url-status=dead|archive-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Introduction ==\n{{Main|Outline of statistics}}\n\nStatistics is a mathematical body of science that pertains to the collection, analysis, interpretation or explanation, and presentation of [[data]],&lt;ref&gt;Moses, Lincoln E.

Populations can be diverse topics such as &quot;all people living in a country&quot; or &quot;every atom composing a crystal&quot;. Ideally, statisticians compile data about the entire population (an operation called [[census]]). This may be organized by governmental statistical institutes. ''[[Descriptive statistics]]'' can be used to summarize the population data. Numerical descriptors include [[mean]] and [[standard deviation]] for [[Continuous probability distribution|continuous data]] types (like income), while frequency and percentage are more useful in terms of describing [[categorical data]] (like education).\n\nWhen a census is not feasible, a chosen subset of the population called a [[sampling (statistics)|sample]] is studied. Once a sample that is representative of the population is determined, data is collected for the sample members in an observational or [[experiment]]al setting. Again, descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the sample data. However, the drawing of the sample has been subject to an element of randomness, hence the established numerical descriptors from the sample are also due to uncertainty. To still draw meaningful conclusions about the entire population, ''[[inferential statistics]]'' is needed. It uses patterns in the sample data to draw inferences about the population represented, accounting for randomness. These inferences may take the form of: answering yes/no questions about the data ([[hypothesis testing]]), estimating numerical characteristics of the data ([[Estimation theory|estimation]]), describing [[Association (statistics)|associations]] within the data ([[correlation and dependence|correlation]]) and modeling relationships within the data (for example, using [[regression analysis]]).  Inference can extend to [[forecasting]], [[prediction]] and estimation of unobserved values either in or associated with the population being studied; it can include [[extrapolation]] and [[interpolation]] of [[time series]] or [[spatial data analysis|spatial data]], and can also include [[data mining]].\n\n===Mathematical statistics===\n{{Main|Mathematical statistics}}\n\nMathematical statistics is the application of [[mathematics]] to statistics.

Today, statistics is widely employed in government, business, and natural and social sciences.\n\nThe mathematical foundations of modern statistics were laid in the 17th century with the development of the [[probability theory]] by [[Gerolamo Cardano]], [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]].

The use of modern [[computer]]s has expedited large-scale statistical computations and has also made possible new methods that are impractical to perform manually. Statistics continues to be an area of active research for example on the problem of how to analyze [[big data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santafe.edu/news/item/sfnm-wood-big-data/|title=Science in a Complex World \u2013 Big Data: Opportunity or Threat?|work=Santa Fe Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Statistical data==\n{{main|Statistical data}}\n\n=== Data collection ===\n\n====Sampling====\nWhen full census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect sample data by developing specific [[design of experiments|experiment designs]] and [[survey sampling|survey samples]]. Statistics itself also provides tools for prediction and forecasting through [[statistical model]]s. The idea of making inferences based on sampled data began around the mid-1600s in connection with estimating populations and developing precursors of life insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1082 1082]|isbn=1-57955-008-8|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1082}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTo use a sample as a guide to an entire population, it is important that it truly represents the overall population. Representative [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole. A major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures. There are also methods of experimental design for experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population.\n\nSampling theory is part of the [[mathematics|mathematical discipline]] of [[probability theory]]. Probability is used in [[statistical theory|mathematical statistics]] to study the [[sampling distribution]]s of [[sample statistic]]s and, more generally, the properties of [[statistical decision theory|statistical procedures]]. The use of any statistical method is valid when the system or population under consideration satisfies the assumptions of the method. The difference in point of view between classic probability theory and sampling theory is, roughly, that probability theory starts from the given parameters of a total population to [[deductive reasoning|deduce]] probabilities that pertain to samples. Statistical inference, however, moves in the opposite direction\u2014[[inductive reasoning|inductively inferring]] from samples to the parameters of a larger or total population.\n\n====Experimental and observational studies====\nA common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate [[causality]], and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the values of predictors or [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variables on dependent variables]]. There are two major types of causal statistical studies: [[Experiment|experimental studies]] and [[Observational study|observational studies]]. In both types of studies, the effect of differences of an independent variable (or variables) on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed. The difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted. Each can be very effective.\nAn experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve [[Scientific control|experimental manipulation]]. Instead, data are gathered and correlations between predictors and response are investigated. While the tools of data analysis work best on data from [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized studies]], they are also applied to other kinds of data\u2014like [[natural experiment]]s and [[Observational study|observational studies]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David A. Freedman (statistician)|Freedman, D.A.]] (2005) ''Statistical Models: Theory and Practice'', Cambridge University Press. {{isbn|978-0-521-67105-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;\u2014for which a statistician would use a modified, more structured estimation method (e.g., [[Difference in differences|Difference in differences estimation]] and [[instrumental variable]]s, among many others) that produce [[consistent estimator]]s.\n\n=====Experiments=====\nThe basic steps of a statistical experiment are:\n# Planning the research, including finding the number of replicates of the study, using the following information:  preliminary estimates regarding the size of [[Average treatment effect|treatment effects]], [[alternative hypothesis|alternative hypotheses]], and the estimated [[experimental error|experimental variability]]. Consideration of the selection of experimental subjects and the ethics of research is necessary. Statisticians recommend that experiments compare (at least) one new treatment with a standard treatment or control, to allow an unbiased estimate of the difference in treatment effects.\n# [[Design of experiments]], using [[blocking (statistics)|blocking]] to reduce the influence of [[confounding variable]]s, and [[randomized assignment]] of treatments to subjects to allow [[bias of an estimator|unbiased estimates]] of treatment effects and experimental error. At this stage, the experimenters and statisticians write the ''[[protocol (natural sciences)|experimental protocol]]'' that will guide the performance of the experiment and which specifies the'' primary analysis'' of the experimental data.\n# Performing the experiment following the [[Protocol (natural sciences)|experimental protocol]] and [[analysis of variance|analyzing the data]] following the experimental protocol.\n# Further examining the data set in secondary analyses, to suggest new hypotheses for future study.\n# Documenting and presenting the results of the study.\n\nExperiments on human behavior have special concerns. The famous [[Hawthorne study]] examined changes to the working environment at the Hawthorne plant of the [[Western Electric Company]]. The researchers were interested in determining whether increased illumination would increase the productivity of the [[assembly line]] workers. The researchers first measured the productivity in the plant, then modified the illumination in an area of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected productivity. It turned out that productivity indeed improved (under the experimental conditions). However, the study is heavily criticized today for errors in experimental procedures, specifically for the lack of a [[control group]] and [[double-blind|blindness]]. The [[Hawthorne effect]] refers to finding that an outcome (in this case, worker productivity) changed due to observation itself. Those in the Hawthorne study became more productive not because the lighting was changed but because they were being observed.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17608932&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McCarney R, Warner J, Iliffe S, van Haselen R, Griffin M, Fisher P |title=The Hawthorne Effect: a randomised, controlled trial |journal=BMC Med Res Methodol |volume=7|pages=30 |year=2007 |pmid=17608932 |pmc=1936999 |doi=10.1186/1471-2288-7-30 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=====Observational study=====\nAn example of an observational study is one that explores the association between smoking and lung cancer. This type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis. In this case, the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and non-smokers, perhaps through a [[cohort study]], and then look for the number of cases of lung cancer in each group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Rothman|editor1-first=Kenneth J|editor2-last=Greenland|editor2-first=Sander|editor3-last=Lash|editor3-first=Timothy|title=Modern Epidemiology|url=https://archive.org/details/modernepidemiolo00roth|url-access=limited|date=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|page=[https://archive.org/details/modernepidemiolo00roth/page/n100 100]|edition=3rd|language=English|chapter=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[case-control study]] is another type of observational study in which people with and without the outcome of interest (e.g. lung cancer) are invited to participate and their exposure histories are collected.\n\n=== Types of data ===\n{{main|Statistical data type||Levels of measurement}}\n\nVarious attempts have been made to produce a taxonomy of [[level of measurement|levels of measurement]]. The psychophysicist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] defined nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales. Nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values, and permit any one-to-one (injective) transformation. Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values, but have a meaningful order to those values, and permit any order-preserving transformation. Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined, but the zero value is arbitrary (as in the case with [[longitude]] and [[temperature]] measurements in [[Celsius]] or [[Fahrenheit]]), and permit any linear transformation. Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined, and permit any rescaling transformation.\n\nBecause variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements cannot be reasonably measured numerically, sometimes they are grouped together as [[categorical variable]]s, whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as [[Variable (mathematics)#Applied statistics|quantitative variables]], which can be either [[Probability distribution#Discrete probability distribution|discrete]] or [[Probability distribution#Continuous probability distribution|continuous]], due to their numerical nature. Such distinctions can often be loosely correlated with [[data type]] in computer science, in that dichotomous categorical variables may be represented with the [[Boolean data type]], polytomous categorical variables with arbitrarily assigned [[integer]]s in the [[integer (computer science)|integral data type]], and continuous variables with the [[real data type]] involving [[floating point]] computation. But the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented.\n\nOther categorizations have been proposed. For example, Mosteller and Tukey (1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mosteller | first1 = F. | authorlink1 = Frederick Mosteller | last2 = Tukey | first2 = J.W | authorlink2 = John Tukey | year = 1977 | title = Data analysis and regression | location = Boston | publisher = Addison-Wesley}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished grades, ranks, counted fractions, counts, amounts, and balances.

Descriptive statistics is distinguished from [[statistical inference|inferential statistics]] (or inductive statistics), in that descriptive statistics aims to summarize a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]], rather than use the data to learn about the [[statistical population|population]] that the sample of data is thought to represent.\n\n=== Inferential statistics ===\n{{main|Statistical inference}}\n\n'''Statistical inference''' is the process of using [[data analysis]] to deduce properties of an underlying [[probability distribution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;&gt;Upton, G., Cook, I.

It is assumed that the observed data set is [[Sampling (statistics)|sampled]] from a larger population. Inferential statistics can be contrasted with [[descriptive statistics]]. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population.\n\n====Terminology and theory of inferential statistics====\n=====Statistics, estimators and pivotal quantities=====\nConsider [[Independent identically distributed|independent identically distributed (IID) random variables]] with a given [[probability distribution]]: standard [[statistical inference]] and [[estimation theory]] defines a [[random sample]] as the [[random vector]] given by the [[column vector]] of these IID variables.&lt;ref name=Piazza&gt;Piazza Elio, Probabilit\u00e0 e Statistica, Esculapio 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Statistical population|population]] being examined is described by a probability distribution that may have unknown parameters.\n\nA [[statistic]] is a random variable that is a function of the random sample, but ''not a function of unknown parameters''. The probability distribution of the statistic, though, may have unknown parameters.\n\nConsider now a function of the unknown parameter: an [[estimator]] is a statistic used to estimate such function. Commonly used estimators include [[Sample mean#Sample mean|sample mean]], unbiased [[sample variance]] and [[Sample covariance#Sample covariance|sample covariance]].\n\nA random variable that is a function of the random sample and of the unknown parameter, but whose probability distribution ''does not depend on the unknown parameter'' is called a [[pivotal quantity]] or pivot. Widely used pivots include the [[z-score]], the [[Chi-squared distribution#Applications|chi square statistic]] and Student's [[Student's t-distribution#How the t-distribution arises|t-value]].\n\nBetween two estimators of a given parameter, the one with lower [[mean squared error]] is said to be more [[Efficient estimator|efficient]]. Furthermore, an estimator is said to be [[Unbiased estimator|unbiased]] if its [[expected value]] is equal to the true value of the unknown parameter being estimated, and asymptotically unbiased if its expected value converges at the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] to the true value of such parameter.\n\nOther desirable properties for estimators include: [[UMVUE]] estimators that have the lowest variance for all possible values of the parameter to be estimated (this is usually an easier property to verify than efficiency) and [[consistent estimator]]s which [[converges in probability]] to the true value of such parameter.\n\nThis still leaves the question of how to obtain estimators in a given situation and carry the computation, several methods have been proposed: the [[method of moments (statistics)|method of moments]], the [[maximum likelihood]] method, the [[least squares]] method and the more recent method of [[estimating equations]].\n\n=====Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis=====\nInterpretation of statistical information can often involve the development of a [[null hypothesis]] which is usually (but not necessarily) that no relationship exists among variables or that no change occurred over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Everitt | first = Brian | title = The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 0521593468 | url = https://archive.org/details/cambridgediction00ever_0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourstatsguru.com/epar/rp-reviewed/cohen1994/|title=Cohen (1994) The Earth Is Round (p &lt; .05) |publisher=YourStatsGuru.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe best illustration for a novice is the predicament encountered by a criminal trial. The null hypothesis, H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, asserts that the defendant is innocent, whereas the alternative hypothesis, H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, asserts that the defendant is guilty. The indictment comes because of suspicion of the guilt. The H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (status quo) stands in opposition to H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and is maintained unless H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is supported by evidence &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;. However, &quot;failure to reject H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&quot; in this case does not imply innocence, but merely that the evidence was insufficient to convict. So the jury does not necessarily ''accept'' H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; but ''fails to reject'' H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. While one can not &quot;prove&quot; a null hypothesis, one can test how close it is to being true with a [[Statistical power|power test]], which tests for [[type II error]]s.\n\nWhat [[statisticians]] call an [[alternative hypothesis]] is simply a hypothesis that contradicts the [[null hypothesis]].\n\n=====Error=====\nWorking from a [[null hypothesis]], two basic forms of error are recognized:\n* [[Type I and type II errors#Type I error|Type I errors]] where the null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a &quot;false positive&quot;.\n* [[Type I and type II errors#Type II error|Type II errors]] where the null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual difference between populations is missed giving a &quot;false negative&quot;.\n\n[[Standard deviation]] refers to the extent to which individual observations in a sample differ from a central value, such as the sample or population mean, while [[Standard error (statistics)#Standard error of the mean|Standard error]] refers to an estimate of difference between sample mean and population mean.\n\nA [[Errors and residuals in statistics#Introduction|statistical error]] is the amount by which an observation differs from its [[expected value]], a [[Errors and residuals in statistics#Introduction|residual]] is the amount an observation differs from the value the estimator of the expected value assumes on a given sample (also called prediction).\n\n[[Mean squared error]] is used for obtaining [[efficient estimators]], a widely used class of estimators. [[Root mean square error]] is simply the square root of mean squared error.\n\n[[File:Linear least squares(2).svg|thumb|right|A least squares fit: in red the points to be fitted, in blue the fitted line.]]\n\nMany statistical methods seek to minimize the [[residual sum of squares]], and these are called &quot;[[least squares|methods of least squares]]&quot; in contrast to [[Least absolute deviations]]. The latter gives equal weight to small and big errors, while the former gives more weight to large errors. Residual sum of squares is also [[Differentiable function|differentiable]], which provides a handy property for doing [[regression analysis|regression]]. Least squares applied to [[linear regression]] is called [[ordinary least squares]] method and least squares applied to [[nonlinear regression]] is called [[non-linear least squares]]. Also in a linear regression model the non deterministic part of the model is called error term, disturbance or more simply noise. Both linear regression and non-linear regression are addressed in [[polynomial least squares]], which also describes the variance in a prediction of the dependent variable (y axis) as a function of the independent variable (x axis) and the deviations (errors, noise, disturbances) from the estimated (fitted) curve.\n\nMeasurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error.  Many of these errors are classified as [[Random error|random]] (noise) or [[Systematic error|systematic]] ([[bias]]), but other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also be important. The presence of [[missing data]] or [[censoring (statistics)|censoring]] may result in [[bias (statistics)|biased estimates]] and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Donald B.; Little, Roderick J.A., Statistical analysis with missing data, New York: Wiley 2002&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=====Interval estimation=====\n{{main|Interval estimation}}\n\n[[File:NYW-confidence-interval.svg|thumb|right|[[Confidence intervals]]: the red line is true value for the mean in this example, the blue lines are random confidence intervals for 100 realizations.]]\n\nMost studies only sample part of a population, so results don't fully represent the whole population. Any estimates obtained from the sample only approximate the population value. [[Confidence intervals]] allow statisticians to express how closely the sample estimate matches the true value in the whole population. Often they are expressed as 95% confidence intervals. Formally, a 95% confidence interval for a value is a range where, if the sampling and analysis were repeated under the same conditions (yielding a different dataset), the interval would include the true (population) value in 95% of all possible cases. This does ''not'' imply that the probability that the true value is in the confidence interval is 95%. From the [[frequentist inference|frequentist]] perspective, such a claim does not even make sense, as the true value is not a [[random variable]].  Either the true value is or is not within the given interval. However, it is true that, before any data are sampled and given a plan for how to construct the confidence interval, the probability is 95% that the yet-to-be-calculated interval will cover the true value: at this point, the limits of the interval are yet-to-be-observed [[random variable]]s. One approach that does yield an interval that can be interpreted as having a given probability of containing the true value is to use a [[credible interval]] from [[Bayesian statistics]]: this approach depends on a different way of [[Probability interpretations|interpreting what is meant by &quot;probability&quot;]], that is as a [[Bayesian probability]].\n\nIn principle confidence intervals can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. An interval can be asymmetrical because it works as lower or upper bound for a parameter (left-sided interval or right sided interval), but it can also be asymmetrical because the two sided interval is built violating symmetry around the estimate. Sometimes the bounds for a confidence interval are reached asymptotically and these are used to approximate the true bounds.\n\n=====Significance=====\n{{main|Statistical significance}}\n\nStatistics rarely give a simple Yes/No type answer to the question under analysis. Interpretation often comes down to the level of statistical significance applied to the numbers and often refers to the probability of a value accurately rejecting the null hypothesis (sometimes referred to as the [[p-value]]).\n\n[[File:P-value in statistical significance testing.svg|upright=1.8|thumb|right|In this graph the black line is probability distribution for the [[test statistic]], the [[Critical region#Definition of terms|critical region]] is the set of values to the right of the observed data point (observed value of the test statistic) and the [[p-value]] is represented by the green area.]]\n\nThe standard approach&lt;ref name=&quot;Piazza&quot;/&gt; is to test a null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis. A [[Critical region#Definition of terms|critical region]] is the set of values of the estimator that leads to refuting the null hypothesis. The probability of type I error is therefore the probability that the estimator belongs to the critical region given that null hypothesis is true ([[statistical significance]]) and the probability of type II error is the probability that the estimator doesn't belong to the critical region given that the alternative hypothesis is true. The [[statistical power]] of a test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.\n\nReferring to statistical significance does not necessarily mean that the overall result is significant in real world terms. For example, in a large study of a drug it may be shown that the drug has a statistically significant but very small beneficial effect, such that the drug is unlikely to help the patient noticeably.\n\nAlthough in principle the acceptable level of [[statistical significance]] may be subject to debate, the [[p-value]] is the smallest significance level that allows the test to reject the null hypothesis. This test is logically equivalent to saying that the p-value is the probability, assuming the null hypothesis is true, of observing a result at least as extreme as the [[test statistic]]. Therefore, the smaller the p-value, the lower the probability of committing type I error.\n\nSome problems are usually associated with this framework (See [[Statistical hypothesis testing#Criticism|criticism of hypothesis testing]]):\n* A difference that is highly statistically significant can still be of no practical significance, but it is possible to properly formulate tests to account for this. One response involves going beyond reporting only the [[significance level]] to include the [[p-value|''p''-value]] when reporting whether a hypothesis is rejected or accepted. The p-value, however, does not indicate the [[effect size|size]] or importance of the observed effect and can also seem to exaggerate the importance of minor differences in large studies. A better and increasingly common approach is to report [[confidence interval]]s. Although these are produced from the same calculations as those of hypothesis tests or ''p''-values, they describe both the size of the effect and the uncertainty surrounding it.\n* Fallacy of the transposed conditional, aka [[prosecutor's fallacy]]: criticisms arise because the hypothesis testing approach forces one hypothesis (the [[null hypothesis]]) to be favored, since what is being evaluated is the probability of the observed result given the null hypothesis and not probability of the null hypothesis given the observed result. An alternative to this approach is offered by [[Bayesian inference]], although it requires establishing a [[prior probability]].&lt;ref name=Ioannidis2005&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ioannidis | first1 = J.P.A. | authorlink1 = John P.A.

For instance, social policy, medical practice, and the reliability of structures like bridges all rely on the proper use of statistics.\n\nEven when statistical techniques are correctly applied, the results can be difficult to interpret for those lacking expertise. The [[statistical significance]] of a trend in the data\u2014which measures the extent to which a trend could be caused by random variation in the sample\u2014may or may not agree with an intuitive sense of its significance. The set of basic statistical skills (and skepticism) that people need to deal with information in their everyday lives properly is referred to as [[statistical literacy]].\n\nThere is a general perception that statistical knowledge is all-too-frequently intentionally [[Misuse of statistics|misused]] by finding ways to interpret only the data that are favorable to the presenter.&lt;ref name=Huff&gt;Huff, Darrell (1954) ''[[How to Lie with Statistics]]'',  WW Norton &amp; Company, Inc.

Statistical analysis of a [[data set]] often reveals that two variables (properties) of the population under consideration tend to vary together, as if they were connected. For example, a study of annual income that also looks at age of death might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people. The two variables are said to be correlated; however, they may or may not be the cause of one another. The correlation phenomena could be caused by a third, previously unconsidered phenomenon, called a lurking variable or [[confounding variable]]. For this reason, there is no way to immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables.

Early statistical models were almost always from the class of [[linear model]]s, but powerful computers, coupled with suitable numerical [[algorithms]], caused an increased interest in [[Nonlinear regression|nonlinear models]] (such as [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]]) as well as the creation of new types, such as [[generalized linear model]]s and [[multilevel model]]s.\n\nIncreased computing power has also led to the growing popularity of computationally intensive methods based on [[Resampling (statistics)|resampling]], such as [[permutation test]]s and the [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]], while techniques such as [[Gibbs sampling]] have made use of [[Bayesian model]]s more feasible. The computer revolution has implications for the future of statistics with a new emphasis on &quot;experimental&quot; and &quot;empirical&quot; statistics. A large number of both general and special purpose [[List of statistical packages|statistical software]] are now available. Examples of available software capable of complex statistical computation include programs such as [[Mathematica]], [[SAS (software)|SAS]], [[SPSS]], and [[R (programming language)|R]].\n\n===Statistics applied to mathematics or the arts===\nTraditionally, statistics was concerned with drawing inferences using a semi-standardized methodology that was &quot;required learning&quot; in most sciences.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} This tradition has changed with the use of statistics in non-inferential contexts. What was once considered a dry subject, taken in many fields as a degree-requirement, is now viewed enthusiastically.{{according to whom|date=April 2014}} Initially derided by some mathematical purists, it is now considered essential methodology in certain areas.\n* In [[number theory]], [[scatter plot]]s of data generated by a distribution function may be transformed with familiar tools used in statistics to reveal underlying patterns, which may then lead to hypotheses.\n* Methods of statistics including predictive methods in [[forecasting]] are combined with [[chaos theory]] and [[fractal geometry]] to create video works that are considered to have great beauty.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n* The [[process art]] of [[Jackson Pollock]] relied on artistic experiments whereby underlying distributions in nature were artistically revealed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} With the advent of computers, statistical methods were applied to formalize such distribution-driven natural processes to make and analyze moving video art.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n* Methods of statistics may be used predicatively in [[performance art]], as in a card trick based on a [[Markov process]] that only works some of the time, the occasion of which can be predicted using statistical methodology.\n* Statistics can be used to predicatively create art, as in the statistical or [[stochastic music]] invented by [[Iannis Xenakis]], where the music is performance-specific. Though this type of artistry does not always come out as expected, it does behave in ways that are predictable and tunable using statistics.\n\n== Specialized disciplines ==\n{{main|List of fields of application of statistics}}\n\nStatistical techniques are used in a wide range of types of scientific and social research, including: [[biostatistics]], [[computational biology]], [[computational sociology]], [[network biology]], [[social science]], [[sociology]] and [[social research]].

In particular, it was the type of knowledge that people can communicate to each other and share. For example, knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before [[recorded history]] and led to the development of complex [[abstract thought]]. This is shown by the construction of complex [[calendar]]s, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, [[public works]] at a national scale, such as those which harnessed the [[floodplain]] of the [[Yangtse]] with [[reservoir]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sima Qian]] (\u53f8\u99ac\u9077, d. 86 BCE) in his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (\u592a\u53f2\u516c\u66f8) covering some 2500 years of Chinese history, records [[Sunshu Ao]] (\u5b6b\u53d4\u6556, fl. c. 630\u2013595 BCE \u2013 [[Zhou dynasty]]), the first known [[hydraulic engineer]] of China, cited in ([[Joseph Needham]] et al.

However, no consistent conscious distinction was made between knowledge of such things, which are true in every community, and other types of communal knowledge, such as mythologies and legal systems. [[Metallurgy]] was known in prehistory, and the [[Vin\u010da culture]] was the earliest known producer of bronze-like alloys.

Voelkel (2001) ''Johannes Kepler and the New Astronomy'' Oxford University Press. Kepler was driven to this experiment after observing the partial solar eclipse at Graz, July 10, 1600. He used Tycho Brahe's method of observation, which was to project the image of the Sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture, instead of looking directly at the Sun. He disagreed with Brahe's conclusion that total eclipses of the Sun were impossible because there were historical accounts of total eclipses. Instead, he deduced that the size of the aperture controls the sharpness of the projected image (the larger the aperture, the more accurate the image&amp;nbsp;\u2013 this fact is now fundamental for optical system design). Voelkel, p. 61, notes that Kepler's experiments produced the first correct account of vision and the eye because he realized he could not accurately write about astronomical observation by ignoring the eye.}} Kepler is best known, however, for improving Copernicus' heliocentric model through the discovery of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]].

[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] and [[Francis Bacon]] published philosophical arguments in favor of a new type of non-Aristotelian science. Descartes emphasized individual thought and argued that mathematics rather than geometry should be used in order to study nature. Bacon emphasized the importance of experiment over contemplation. Bacon further questioned the Aristotelian concepts of formal cause and final cause, and promoted the idea that science should study the laws of &quot;simple&quot; natures, such as heat, rather than assuming that there is any specific nature, or &quot;[[formal cause]]&quot;, of each complex type of thing. This new science began to see itself as describing &quot;[[Physical law|laws of nature]]&quot;. This updated approach to studies in nature was seen as [[mechanistic]]. Bacon also argued that science should aim for the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all human life.\n\n=== Age of Enlightenment ===\n{{Main|Age of Enlightenment}}\n[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.0|left|[[Isaac Newton]], shown here in a 1689 portrait, made seminal contributions to [[classical mechanics]], [[gravity]], and [[optics]]. Newton shares credit with [[Gottfried Leibniz]] for the development of calculus.]]\nAs a precursor to the [[Age of Enlightenment]], [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] succeeded in developing a new physics, now referred to as [[classical mechanics]], which could be confirmed by experiment and explained using mathematics (Newton (1687), ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''). Leibniz also incorporated terms from [[Aristotelian physics]], but now being used in a new non-teleological way, for example, &quot;[[energy]]&quot; and &quot;[[potential]]&quot; (modern versions of Aristotelian &quot;[[actuality and potentiality|''energeia'' and ''potentia'']]&quot;). This implied a shift in the view of objects: Where Aristotle had noted that objects have certain innate goals that can be actualized, objects were now regarded as devoid of innate goals. In the style of Francis Bacon, Leibniz assumed that different types of things all work according to the same general laws of nature, with no special formal or final causes for each type of thing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Leibniz.html MacTutor Archive, Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz]&lt;/ref&gt; It is during this period that the word &quot;science&quot; gradually became more commonly used to refer to a ''type of pursuit'' of a type of knowledge, especially knowledge of nature&amp;nbsp;\u2013 coming close in meaning to the old term &quot;[[natural philosophy]].&quot;\n\nDuring this time, the declared purpose and value of science became producing wealth and [[invention]]s that would improve human lives, in the [[Economic materialism|materialistic]] sense of having more food, clothing, and other things. In [[Novum Organum|Bacon's words]], &quot;the real and legitimate goal of sciences is the endowment of human life with new inventions and riches&quot;, and he discouraged scientists from pursuing intangible philosophical or spiritual ideas, which he believed contributed little to human happiness beyond &quot;the fume of subtle, sublime, or pleasing speculation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PgmbZIybuRoC&amp;pg=PA162|title= The Social and Economic Roots of the Scientific Revolution: Texts by Boris Hessen and Henryk Grossmann|last1= Freudenthal|first1= Gideon|last2= McLaughlin|first2= Peter|date= 2009-05-20|publisher= Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn= 9781402096044}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nScience during the Enlightenment was dominated by [[scientific society|scientific societies]]&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G.

Societies and academies were also the backbones of the maturation of the scientific profession. Another important development was the [[popular culture|popularization]] of science among an increasingly literate population.

Ross 1962, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' he established [[evolution]] as the prevailing explanation of biological complexity. His theory of [[natural selection]] provided a natural explanation of how [[species]] originated, but this only gained wide acceptance a century later.\n\nThe laws of [[conservation of energy]], [[conservation of momentum]] and [[conservation of mass]] suggested a highly stable universe where there could be little loss of resources. With the advent of the steam engine and the [[industrial revolution]], there was, however, an increased understanding that all forms of energy as defined in physics were not equally useful: they did not have the same [[energy quality]]. This realization led to the development of the laws of [[thermodynamics]], in which the free energy of the universe is seen as constantly declining: the [[entropy]] of a closed universe increases over time.\n\nThe [[electromagnetic theory]] was also established in the 19th century, and raised new questions which could not easily be answered using Newton's framework. The phenomena that would allow the deconstruction of the [[atom]] were discovered in the last decade of the 19th century: the discovery of [[X-ray]]s inspired the discovery of [[radioactivity]]. In the next year came the discovery of the first subatomic particle, the [[electron]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[File:DNA animation.gif|thumb|right|The [[DNA]] [[double helix]] is a [[molecule]] that encodes the [[genetics|genetic]] instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living [[organism]]s and many [[virus]]es.]]\n[[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]] and the development of [[quantum mechanics]] led to the replacement of classical mechanics with a new physics which contains two parts that describe different types of events in nature.\n\nIn the first half of the century, the development of [[antibiotics]] and [[artificial fertilizer]] made global human [[population growth]] possible. At the same time, the structure of the atom and its nucleus was discovered, leading to the release of &quot;[[atomic energy]]&quot; ([[nuclear power]]). In addition, the extensive use of technological innovation stimulated by the wars of this century led to revolutions in transportation ([[automobile]]s and [[aircraft]]), the development of [[ICBM]]s, a [[space race]], and a [[nuclear arms race]].\n\nThe molecular structure of [[DNA]] was discovered in 1953. The discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] in 1964 led to a rejection of the [[Steady State theory]] of the universe in favour of the [[Big Bang]] theory of [[Georges Lema\u00eetre]].\n\nThe development of [[spaceflight]] in the second half of the century allowed the first astronomical measurements done on or near other objects in space, including [[Apollo program|manned landings on the Moon]]. [[Space telescope]]s lead to numerous discoveries in astronomy and cosmology.\n\nWidespread use of [[integrated circuit]]s in the last quarter of the 20th century combined with [[communications satellite]]s led to a revolution in [[information technology]] and the rise of the global [[internet]] and [[mobile computing]], including [[smartphone]]s.

It has many branches that include, but are not limited to, [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[communication studies]], [[economics]], [[history]], [[human geography]], [[jurisprudence]], [[linguistics]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[public health]], and [[sociology]]. Social scientists may adopt various [[philosophical theories]] to study individuals and society. For example, [[Positivism|positivist]] social scientists use methods resembling those of the [[natural science]]s as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter [[Modern science|modern sense]]. [[Antipositivism|Interpretivist]] social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically [[falsifiable]] theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense. In modern academic practice, researchers are often [[Eclecticism|eclectic]], using multiple [[Methodology|methodologies]] (for instance, by combining both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research]]). The term &quot;[[social research]]&quot; has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods.\n\n=== Formal science ===\n{{Main|Formal science|Outline of formal science}}\n[[Formal science]] is involved in the study of [[formal systems]].

The formal sciences share similarities with the other two branches by relying on objective, careful, and systematic study of an area of knowledge.

This leads to options for technological advances that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable.

We ... now rolled the ball only one-quarter the length of the channel; and having measured the time of its descent, we found it precisely one-half of the former. Next, we tried other distances, comparing the time for the whole length with that for the half, or with that for two-thirds, or three-fourths, or indeed for any fraction; in such experiments, repeated many, many, times.&quot; Galileo solved the problem of time measurement by weighing a jet of water collected during the descent of the bronze ball, as stated in his ''Two New Sciences''.}} which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations.&lt;ref name= Godfrey-Smith2003c&gt;{{cite book| last=Godfrey-Smith | first=Peter | year=2003c | chapter = Induction and confirmation | title= Theory and Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science | url=https://archive.org/details/theoryrealityint00godf | url-access=limited | edition = 1st | publisher= University of Chicago| isbn= 978-0-226-30062-7| pages=[https://archive.org/details/theoryrealityint00godf/page/n53 39]\u201356 | location= Chicago, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empiricism generally encompasses [[inductivism]], a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories.

He characterized ''normal science'' as the process of observation and &quot;puzzle solving&quot; which takes place within a paradigm, whereas ''revolutionary science'' occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a [[paradigm shift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/thomas-kuhn/ |title = Thomas Kuhn |accessdate = 2015-10-26 |last = Bird |first = Alexander |year = 2013 |website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor1-last= Zalta |editor1-first= Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more &quot;portraits&quot; against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. A paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of [[relativism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KuhnP206&quot;&gt;T.S.

Its main point is that a difference between natural and [[supernatural]] explanations should be made and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations.&lt;ref name=Godfrey-Smith2003j&gt;{{cite book| last= Godfrey-Smith | first= Peter | year= 2003j | chapter = Naturalistic philosophy in theory and practice | title= Theory and Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science | url= https://archive.org/details/theoryrealityint00godf | url-access= limited | edition = 1st | publisher= University of Chicago| isbn=978-0-226-30062-7| pages=[https://archive.org/details/theoryrealityint00godf/page/n163 149]\u2013162 | location= Chicago, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|credits [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] (1969) &quot;Epistemology Naturalized&quot; ''Ontological Relativity and Other Essays'' New York: Columbia University Press, as well as [[John Dewey]], with the basic ideas of naturalism&amp;nbsp;\u2013 [[Naturalized Epistemology]], but Godfrey-Smith diverges from Quine's position: according to Godfrey-Smith, &quot;A naturalist can think that science can contribute to ''answers'' to philosophical questions, without thinking that philosophical questions can be replaced by science questions.&quot;.}} That the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not claim them to be wrong either. Instead, supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief [[Non-overlapping magisteria|outside the scope of science]].

Science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies. Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences. In accordance with [[public policy]] being concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public.\n\n[[State (polity)|State]] [[policy]] has influenced the funding of [[public works]] and science for thousands of years, particularly within civilizations with highly organized governments such as [[History of China|imperial China]] and the [[Roman Empire]]. Prominent historical examples include the [[Great Wall of China]], completed over the course of two millennia through the state support of [[Dynasties in Chinese history|several dynasties]], and the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] of the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]], an immense feat of [[hydraulic engineering]] begun by [[Sunshu Ao]] (\u5b6b\u53d4\u6556 7th c. BCE), [[Ximen Bao]] (\u897f\u9580\u8c79 5th c.BCE), and Shi Chi (4th c. BCE). This construction dates from the 6th century BCE under the [[Sui dynasty|Sui Dynasty]] and is still in use today. In China, such state-supported infrastructure and scientific research projects date at least from the time of the [[Mohists]], who inspired the study of [[logic]] during the period of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] and the study of defensive fortifications like the Great Wall of China during the [[Warring States period]].\n\nPublic policy can directly affect the funding of [[capital equipment]] and intellectual infrastructure for industrial research by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund research.

It is one of the [[plastic arts]]. Durable sculptural processes originally used [[carving]] (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in [[stone]], [[metal]], [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[wood]] and other materials but, since [[Modernism]], there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by [[welding]] or modelling, or [[Molding (process)|moulded]] or [[Casting|cast]].\n\nSculpture in stone survives far better than works of art in perishable materials, and often represents the majority of the surviving works (other than [[pottery]]) from ancient cultures, though conversely traditions of sculpture in wood may have vanished almost entirely. However, most ancient sculpture was brightly painted, and this has been lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;artmuseums.harvard.edu&quot;&gt;[http://www.artmuseums.harvard.edu/exhibitions/sackler/godsInColor.html &quot;Gods in Color: Painted Sculpture of Classical Antiquity&quot; September 2007 to January 2008, The Arthur M. Sackler Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104060402/http://www.artmuseums.harvard.edu/exhibitions/sackler/godsInColor.html |date=January 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSculpture has been central in religious devotion in many cultures, and until recent centuries large sculptures, too expensive for private individuals to create, were usually an expression of religion or politics. Those cultures whose sculptures have survived in quantities include the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, India and China, as well as many in Central and South America and Africa.\n\nThe [[Western culture|Western]] tradition of sculpture began in [[ancient Greece]], and Greece is widely seen as producing great masterpieces in the [[Classical Greece|classical]] period. During the [[Middle Ages]], [[Gothic art|Gothic]] sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith. The revival of classical models in the [[Renaissance]] produced famous sculptures such as [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]''. Modernist sculpture moved away from traditional processes and the emphasis on the depiction of the human body, with the making of [[Assemblage (art)|constructed sculpture]], and the presentation of [[found object]]s as finished art works.\n\n==Types==\nA basic distinction is between sculpture in the round, free-standing sculpture, such as [[statue]]s, not attached (except possibly at the base) to any other surface, and the various types of [[relief]], which are at least partly attached to a background surface. Relief is often classified by the degree of projection from the wall into low or [[bas-relief]], [[alto-relievo|high relief]], and sometimes an intermediate [[mid-relief]]. [[Sunk-relief]] is a technique restricted to [[ancient Egypt]]. Relief is the usual sculptural medium for large figure groups and narrative subjects, which are difficult to accomplish in the round, and is the typical technique used both for [[architectural sculpture]], which is attached to buildings, and for small-scale sculpture decorating other objects, as in much [[pottery]], metalwork and [[jewellery]]. Relief sculpture may also decorate [[stele]]s, upright slabs, usually of stone, often also containing inscriptions.\n\nAnother basic distinction is between subtractive carving techniques, which remove material from an existing block or lump, for example of stone or wood, and modelling techniques which shape or build up the work from the material. Techniques such as [[casting]], stamping and moulding use an intermediate matrix containing the design to produce the work; many of these allow the production of several copies.\n\n[[File:\u9f99\u95e8-Buddha.jpg|thumb|left|Open air Buddhist [[rock relief]]s at the [[Longmen Grottoes]], China]]\nThe term &quot;sculpture&quot; is often used mainly to describe large works, which are sometimes called [[monumental sculpture]], meaning either or both of sculpture that is large, or that is attached to a building. But the term properly covers many types of small works in three dimensions using the same techniques, including coins and [[medal]]s, [[hardstone carving]]s, a term for small carvings in stone that can take detailed work.\n\nThe very large or &quot;colossal&quot; statue has had an enduring appeal since [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]; the [[List of statues by height|largest on record]] at {{convert|182|m|ft|abbr=on}} is the 2018 Indian [[Statue of Unity]]. Another grand form of portrait sculpture is the [[equestrian statue]] of a rider on horse, which has become rare in recent decades. The smallest forms of life-size portrait sculpture are the &quot;head&quot;, showing just that, or the [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]], a representation of a person from the chest up. Small forms of sculpture include the [[figurine]], normally a statue that is no more than {{convert|18|in|cm}} tall, and for reliefs the [[plaquette]], medal or coin.\n\nModern and contemporary art have added a number of non-traditional forms of sculpture, including [[sound sculpture]], [[light sculpture]], [[environmental art]], [[environmental sculpture]], [[Lock On (street art)|street art sculpture]], [[Kinetic art|kinetic sculpture]] (involving aspects of [[Motion (physics)|physical motion]]), [[land art]], and [[site-specific art]]. Sculpture is an important form of [[public art]]. A collection of sculpture in a garden setting can be called a [[sculpture garden]].\n\n==Purposes and subjects==\n[[File:Mo\u00e1is.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''[[Moai]]'' from [[Easter Island]], where the concentration of resources on large sculpture may have had serious political effects.]]\nOne of the most common purposes of sculpture is in some form of association with religion. [[Cult image]]s are common in many cultures, though they are often not the colossal statues of deities which characterized [[ancient Greek art]], like the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]]. The actual cult images in the innermost sanctuaries of [[Egyptian temple]]s, of which none have survived, were evidently rather small, even in the largest temples. The same is often true in [[Hinduism]], where the very simple and ancient form of the [[lingam]] is the most common. [[Buddhism]] brought the sculpture of religious figures to East Asia, where there seems to have been no earlier equivalent tradition, though again simple shapes like the ''[[bi (jade)|bi]]'' and ''[[cong (jade)|cong]]'' probably had religious significance.\n\nSmall sculptures as personal possessions go back to the earliest prehistoric art, and the use of very large sculpture as [[public art]], especially to impress the viewer with the power of a ruler, goes back at least to the [[Great Sphinx]] of some 4,500 years ago. In [[archaeology]] and art history the appearance, and sometimes disappearance, of large or monumental sculpture in a culture is regarded as of great significance, though tracing the emergence is often complicated by the presumed existence of sculpture in wood and other perishable materials of which no record remains;&lt;ref name=&quot;Google books&quot;&gt;See for example Martin Robertson, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BoUsvD1_VNQC&amp;pg=PA9 A shorter history of Greek art]'', p. 9, Cambridge University Press, 1981, {{ISBN|978-0-521-28084-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe [[totem pole]] is an example of a tradition of monumental sculpture in wood that would leave no traces for archaeology. The ability to summon the resources to create monumental sculpture, by transporting usually very heavy materials and arranging for the payment of what are usually regarded as full-time sculptors, is considered a mark of a relatively advanced culture in terms of social organization. Recent unexpected discoveries of ancient Chinese [[Bronze Age]] figures at [[Sanxingdui]], some more than twice human size, have disturbed many ideas held about early Chinese civilization, since only much smaller bronzes were previously known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/chinatp_san.shtm NGA, Washington] feature on exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSome undoubtedly advanced cultures, such as the [[Indus Valley civilization]], appear to have had no monumental sculpture at all, though producing very sophisticated figurines and seals. The [[Mississippian culture]] seems to have been progressing towards its use, with small stone figures, when it collapsed. Other cultures, such as ancient Egypt and the [[History of Easter Island|Easter Island culture]], seem to have devoted enormous resources to very large-scale monumental sculpture from a very early stage.\n[[File:National gallery in washington d.c., pisanello, medaglia di giovanni di bisanzio recto.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[Medal of John VIII Palaeologus]], c. 1435, by [[Pisanello]], the first portrait medal, a medium essentially made for collecting.]]\n\nThe collecting of sculpture, including that of earlier periods, goes back some 2,000 years in Greece, China and Mesoamerica, and many collections were available on semi-public display long before the modern [[museum]] was invented. From the 20th century the relatively restricted range of subjects found in large sculpture expanded greatly, with abstract subjects and the use or representation of any type of subject now common. Today much sculpture is made for intermittent display in galleries and museums, and the ability to transport and store the increasingly large works is a factor in their construction. Small decorative [[figurine]]s, most often in ceramics, are as popular today (though strangely neglected by [[Modern art|modern]] and [[Contemporary art]]) as they were in the [[Rococo]], or in ancient Greece when [[Tanagra figurines]] were a major industry, or in East Asian and [[Pre-Columbian art]]. Small sculpted fittings for furniture and other objects go well back into antiquity, as in the [[Nimrud ivories]], [[Begram ivories]] and finds from the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]].\n\nPortrait sculpture began in Egypt, where the [[Narmer Palette]] shows a ruler of the 32nd century BCE, and [[Mesopotamia]], where we have 27 surviving [[statues of Gudea]], who ruled [[Lagash]] c. 2144\u20132124 BCE. In ancient Greece and Rome, the erection of a portrait statue in a public place was almost the highest mark of honour, and the ambition of the elite, who might also be depicted on a coin.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Ptolemies]] began the Hellenistic tradition of ruler-portraits on coins, and the Romans began to show dead politicians in the 1st century BCE, with [[Julius Caesar]] the first living figure to be portrayed; under the emperors portraits of the Imperial family became standard. See Burnett, 34\u201335; Howgego, 63\u201370.&lt;/ref&gt; In other cultures such as Egypt and the Near East public statues were almost exclusively the preserve of the ruler, with other wealthy people only being portrayed in their tombs. Rulers are typically the only people given portraits in Pre-Columbian cultures, beginning with the [[Olmec colossal heads]] of about 3,000 years ago. East Asian portrait sculpture was entirely religious, with leading clergy being commemorated with statues, especially the founders of monasteries, but not rulers, or ancestors. The Mediterranean tradition revived, initially only for tomb effigies and coins, in the Middle Ages, but expanded greatly in the Renaissance, which invented new forms such as the personal portrait [[medal]].\n\nAnimals are, with the human figure, the earliest subject for sculpture, and have always been popular, sometimes realistic, but often imaginary monsters; in China animals and monsters are almost the only traditional subjects for stone sculpture outside tombs and temples. The kingdom of plants is important only in jewellery and decorative reliefs, but these form almost all the large sculpture of [[Byzantine art]] and [[Islamic art]], and are very important in most Eurasian traditions, where motifs such as the [[palmette]] and vine scroll have passed east and west for over two millennia.\n\nOne form of sculpture found in many prehistoric cultures around the world is specially enlarged versions of ordinary tools, weapons or vessels created in impractical precious materials, for either some form of ceremonial use or display or as offerings. [[Jade]] or other types of [[greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] were used in China, [[Olmec]] Mexico, and [[Neolithic Europe]], and in early Mesopotamia large pottery shapes were produced in stone. Bronze was used in Europe and China for large axes and blades, like the [[Oxborough Dirk]].\n\n==Materials and techniques==\n[[File:Mesopotamia male worshiper 2750-2600 B.C.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sumer]]ian male worshipper, alabaster with shell eyes, 2750\u22122600 BCE]]\nThe materials used in sculpture are diverse, changing throughout history. The classic materials, with outstanding durability, are metal, especially [[bronze]], stone and pottery, with wood, bone and [[antler]] less durable but cheaper options. Precious materials such as [[gold]], [[silver]], [[jade]], and [[ivory]] are often used for small luxury works, and sometimes in larger ones, as in [[Chryselephantine sculpture|chryselephantine]] statues. More common and less expensive materials were used for sculpture for wider consumption, including [[hardwood]]s (such as [[oak]], [[Buxus|box/boxwood]], and [[Tilia|lime/linden]]); [[terracotta]] and other [[ceramic]]s, wax (a very common material for models for casting, and receiving the impressions of [[cylinder seal]]s and engraved gems), and cast metals such as [[pewter]] and [[zinc]] (spelter). But a vast number of other materials have been used as part of sculptures, in ethnographic and ancient works as much as modern ones.\n\nSculptures are often [[paint]]ed, but commonly lose their paint to time, or restorers. Many different painting techniques have been used in making sculpture, including [[tempera]], [[oil painting]], [[gilding]], house paint, aerosol, enamel and sandblasting.&lt;ref name=&quot;artmuseums.harvard.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flashpointmag.com/sculptur.htm Article by Morris Cox.]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nMany sculptors seek new ways and materials to make art. One of [[Pablo Picasso]]'s most famous sculptures included [[bicycle]] parts. [[Alexander Calder]] and other modernists made spectacular use of painted [[steel]]. Since the 1960s, [[acryl group|acrylics]] and other plastics have been used as well. [[Andy Goldsworthy]] makes his unusually ephemeral sculptures from almost entirely natural materials in natural settings. Some sculpture, such as [[ice sculpture]], [[sand sculpture]], and [[gas sculpture]], is deliberately short-lived. Recent sculptors have used [[stained glass]], tools, machine parts, hardware and consumer packaging to fashion their works. Sculptors sometimes use [[found objects]], and [[Chinese scholar's rocks]] have been appreciated for many centuries.\n\n===Stone===\n[[File:Istanbul - Museo archeologico - Mostra sul colore nell'antichit\u00e0 08 - Foto G.

Owing to the permanence of the material, evidence can be found that even the earliest societies indulged in some form of stone work, though not all areas of the world have such abundance of good stone for carving as Egypt, Greece, India and most of Europe. [[Petroglyph]]s (also called rock engravings) are perhaps the earliest form: images created by removing part of a rock surface which remains ''in situ'', by incising, pecking, carving, and abrading. [[Monumental sculpture]] covers large works, and [[architectural sculpture]], which is attached to buildings. [[Hardstone carving]] is the carving for artistic purposes of [[semi-precious]] stones such as [[jade]], [[agate]], [[onyx]], [[rock crystal]], [[sard]] or [[carnelian]], and a general term for an object made in this way. [[Alabaster]] or mineral [[gypsum]] is a soft mineral that is easy to carve for smaller works and still relatively durable. [[Engraved gems]] are small carved gems, including [[cameo (carving)|cameos]], originally used as [[seal ring]]s.\n\nThe copying of an original statue in stone, which was very important for ancient Greek statues, which are nearly all known from copies, was traditionally achieved by &quot;[[Pointing machine|pointing]]&quot;, along with more freehand methods. Pointing involved setting up a grid of string squares on a wooden frame surrounding the original, and then measuring the position on the grid and the distance between grid and statue of a series of individual points, and then using this information to carve into the block from which the copy is made.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 147; he notes that ancient Greek copyists seem to have used many fewer points than some later ones, and copies often vary considerably in the composition as well as the finish.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Metal===\n[[File:Refugees medal DSCF9937.JPG|thumb|[[Ludwig Gies]], cast iron [[plaquette]], 8 x 9.8 cm, ''Refugees'', 1915]]\n[[Bronze]] and related [[copper alloy]]s are the oldest and still the most popular metals for [[Casting|cast]] metal [[sculptures]]; a cast [[bronze sculpture]] is often called simply a &quot;bronze&quot;. Common bronze alloys have the unusual and desirable property of expanding slightly just before they set, thus filling the finest details of a mould. Their strength and lack of brittleness (ductility) is an advantage when figures in action are to be created, especially when compared to various [[ceramic]] or stone materials (see [[marble sculpture]] for several examples). [[Gold]] is the softest and most precious metal, and very important in [[jewellery]]; with [[silver]] it is soft enough to be worked with hammers and other tools as well as cast; [[repouss\u00e9 and chasing]] are among the techniques used in gold and [[silversmithing]].\n\n[[Casting]] is a group of manufacturing processes by which a liquid material (bronze, copper, glass, aluminum, iron) is (usually) poured into a mould, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. The solid casting is then ejected or broken out to complete the process,&lt;ref name=&quot;jepsculpture&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Flash animation of the lost-wax casting process | website = | publisher = James Peniston Sculpture | date = | url = http://www.jepsculpture.com/bronze.shtml| doi = | accessdate = November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a final stage of &quot;cold work&quot; may follow on the finished cast. Casting may be used to form hot liquid metals or various materials that ''cold set'' after mixing of components (such as [[epoxies]], [[concrete]], [[plaster]] and [[clay]]). Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods. The oldest surviving casting is a copper Mesopotamian frog from 3200 BCE.&lt;ref name=mco&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Ravi| first = B.| title = Metal Casting \u2013 Overview| publisher = Bureau of Energy Efficiency, India| year = 2004| url = http://www.emt-india.net/process/foundries/pdf/CDA1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific techniques include [[lost-wax casting]], [[plaster mould casting]] and [[sand casting]].\n\n[[Welding]] is a process where different pieces of metal are fused together to create different shapes and designs. There are many different forms of welding, such as [[Oxy-fuel welding]], [[Stick welding]], [[MIG welding]], and [[TIG welding]]. Oxy-fuel is probably the most common method of welding when it comes to creating steel sculptures because it is the easiest to use for shaping the steel as well as making clean and less noticeable joins of the steel. The key to Oxy-fuel welding is heating each piece of metal to be joined evenly until all are red and have a shine to them. Once that shine is on each piece, that shine will soon become a 'pool' where the metal is liquified and the welder must get the pools to join together, fusing the metal. Once cooled off, the location where the pools joined are now one continuous piece of metal. Also used heavily in Oxy-fuel sculpture creation is forging. [[Forging]] is the process of heating metal to a certain point to soften it enough to be shaped into different forms. One very common example is heating the end of a steel rod and hitting the red heated tip with a hammer while on an anvil to form a point. In between hammer swings, the forger rotates the rod and gradually forms a sharpened point from the blunt end of a steel rod.\n\n===Glass===\n[[File:Chihuly glass in boat, morning, Palm House - geograph.org.uk - 297500.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dale Chihuly]], 2006, ([[Blown glass]])]]\n[[Glass]] may be used for sculpture through a wide range of working techniques, though the use of it for large works is a recent development. It can be carved, with considerable difficulty; the Roman [[Lycurgus Cup]] is all but unique.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/t/the_lycurgus_cup.aspx British Museum \u2013 The Lycurgus Cup.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hot casting can be done by ladling molten glass into moulds that have been created by pressing shapes into sand, carved graphite or detailed plaster/silica moulds. Kiln casting glass involves heating chunks of glass in a kiln until they are liquid and flow into a waiting mould below it in the kiln. Glass can also be blown and/or hot sculpted with hand tools either as a solid mass or as part of a blown object. More recent techniques involve chiseling and bonding plate glass with polymer silicates and UV light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Arthur|title=The Sculpture Reference Illustrated|date=2005|location=Gulfport, MS|isbn=978-0-9755383-0-2|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Wood Bodhisattva.jpg|thumb|A carved wooden [[Bodhisattva]] from China's [[Song dynasty]] 960\u20131279, [[Shanghai Museum]]]]\n\n===Pottery===\nPottery is one of the oldest materials for sculpture, as well as clay being the medium in which many sculptures cast in metal are originally modelled for casting. Sculptors often build small preliminary works called [[maquette]]s of ephemeral materials such as [[plaster|plaster of Paris]], wax, unfired clay, or [[plasticine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/s/clay-into-terracotta/ V&amp;A Museum, Sculpture techniques: modelling in clay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120802094251/http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/s/clay-into-terracotta/ |date=August 2, 2012 }}, accessed August 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many cultures have produced pottery which combines a function as a vessel with a sculptural form, and small [[figurine]]s have often been as popular as they are in modern Western culture. Stamps and moulds were used by most ancient civilizations, from [[Ancient Roman pottery|ancient Rome]] and Mesopotamia to China.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 140\u201344; Frankfort 112\u201313; Henig, 179\u201380.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Wood carving===\n[[File:Detalle crucificado Luj\u00e1n P\u00e9rez, 1793.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of Crucifixion of Jesus Christ, Spanish, wood and polychrome, 1793.]]\n[[Wood carving]] has been extremely widely practiced, but survives much less well than the other main materials, being vulnerable to decay, insect damage, and fire. It therefore forms an important hidden element in the art history of many cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Google books&quot;/&gt;  Outdoor wood sculpture does not last long in most parts of the world, so that we have little idea how the [[totem pole]] tradition developed. Many of the most important sculptures of China and Japan in particular are in wood, and the great majority of [[African sculpture]] and that of [[Oceania]] and other regions.\n\nWood is light, so suitable for masks and other sculpture intended to be carried, and can take very fine detail. It is also much easier to work than stone.  It has been very often painted after carving, but the paint wears less well than the wood, and is often missing in surviving pieces.  Painted wood is often technically described as &quot;wood and [[polychrome]]&quot;.  Typically a layer of [[gesso]] or plaster is applied to the wood, and then the paint is applied to that.\n\n==Social status of sculptors==\n[[File:Adam Kraft.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nuremberg]] sculptor [[Adam Kraft]], self-portrait from ''St Lorenz Church'', 1490s.]]\nWorldwide, sculptors have usually been tradesmen whose work is unsigned; in some traditions, for example China, where sculpture did not share the prestige of [[literati painting]], this has affected the status of sculpture itself.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 134\u201335.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in [[ancient Greece]], where sculptors such as [[Phidias]] became famous, they appear to have retained much the same social status as other artisans, and perhaps not much greater financial rewards, although some signed their works.&lt;ref&gt;Burford, Alison, &quot;Greece, ancient, \u00a7IV, 1: Monumental sculpture: Overview, 5 c)&quot; in [[Oxford Art Online]], accessed August 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Middle Ages]] artists such as the 12th-century [[Gislebertus]] sometimes signed their work, and were sought after by different cities, especially from the [[Trecento]] onwards in Italy, with figures such as [[Arnolfo di Cambio]], and [[Nicola Pisano]] and his son [[Giovanni Pisano|Giovanni]]. Goldsmiths and jewellers, dealing with precious materials and often doubling as bankers, belonged to powerful [[guild]]s and had considerable status, often holding civic office. Many sculptors also practised in other arts; [[Andrea del Verrocchio]] also painted, and [[Giovanni Pisano]], Michelangelo, and [[Jacopo Sansovino]] were [[Architecture|architects]]. Some sculptors maintained large workshops. Even in the Renaissance the physical nature of the work was perceived by Leonardo da Vinci and others as pulling down the status of sculpture in the arts, though the reputation of Michelangelo perhaps put this long-held idea to rest.\n\nFrom the [[High Renaissance]] artists such as Michelangelo, [[Leone Leoni]] and [[Giambologna]] could become wealthy, and ennobled, and enter the circle of princes, after a period of sharp argument over the relative status of sculpture and painting.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, 150\u201351; Blunt.&lt;/ref&gt;  Much decorative sculpture on buildings remained a trade, but sculptors producing individual pieces were recognised on a level with painters. From the 18th century or earlier sculpture also attracted middle-class students, although it was slower to do so than painting. Women sculptors took longer to appear than women painters, and were less prominent until the 20th century.\n\n==Anti-sculpture movements==\n[[Aniconism]] remained restricted to [[Judaism]], which did not accept figurative sculpture until the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0018_0_17899.html Jewish virtual library, History of Jewish sculpture.]&lt;/ref&gt; before expanding to [[Early Christianity]], which initially accepted large sculptures. In Christianity and Buddhism, sculpture became very significant. Christian [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] has never accepted monumental sculpture, and [[Islam]] has consistently rejected nearly all figurative sculpture, except for very small figures in reliefs and some animal figures that fulfill a useful function, like the famous lions supporting a fountain in the [[Alhambra]]. Many forms of [[Protestantism]] also do not approve of religious sculpture. There has been much [[iconoclasm]] of sculpture from religious motives, from the Early Christians, the [[Beeldenstorm]] of the [[Protestant Reformation]] to the 2001 destruction of the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]] by the [[Taliban]].\n\n==History{{anchor|History_of_sculpture}}==\n\n=== Prehistoric periods ===\n====Europe====\n[[File:Venus-of-Schelklingen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Venus of Hohle Fels]] (also known as the [[Venus of Schelklingen]]; is an [[Upper Paleolithic]] [[Venus figurines|Venus figurine]] [[ivory carving|hewn from ivory]] of a [[mammoth]] [[tusk]] found in 2008 near [[Schelklingen]], [[Germany]].

The main figures in reliefs adhere to the same figure convention as in painting, with parted legs (where not seated) and head shown from the side, but the torso from the front, and a standard set of proportions making up the figure, using 18 &quot;fists&quot; to go from the ground to the hair-line on the forehead.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; This appears as early as the [[Narmer Palette]] from Dynasty I. However, there as elsewhere the convention is not used for minor figures shown engaged in some activity, such as the captives and corpses.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 12\u201313 and note 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other conventions make statues of males darker than females ones. Very conventionalized portrait statues appear from as early as Dynasty II, before 2,780 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 21\u201324.&lt;/ref&gt; and with the exception of the [[Amarna art|art of the Amarna period]] of [[Ahkenaten]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 170\u201378, 192\u201394.&lt;/ref&gt; and some other periods such as Dynasty XII, the idealized features of rulers, like other Egyptian artistic conventions, changed little until after the Greek conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 102\u201303, 133\u201334.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nEgyptian [[pharaoh]]s were always regarded as deities, but other deities are much less common in large statues, except when they represent the pharaoh ''as'' another deity; however the other deities are frequently shown in paintings and reliefs. The famous row of four colossal statues outside the [[Abu Simbel temples|main temple at Abu Simbel]] each show [[Rameses II]], a typical scheme, though here exceptionally large.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 4\u20135, 208\u201309.&lt;/ref&gt;  Small figures of deities, or their animal personifications, are very common, and found in popular materials such as pottery. Most larger sculpture survives from [[Egyptian temple]]s or tombs; by Dynasty IV (2680\u20132565 BCE) at the latest the idea of the [[Ka statue]] was firmly established. These were put in tombs as a resting place for the [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul|''ka'' portion of the soul]], and so we have a good number of less conventionalized statues of well-off administrators and their wives, many in wood as Egypt is one of the few places in the world where the climate allows wood to survive over millennia. The so-called [[reserve head]]s, plain hairless heads, are especially naturalistic. Early tombs also contained small models of the slaves, animals, buildings and objects such as boats necessary for the deceased to continue his lifestyle in the afterworld, and later ''[[Ushabti]]'' figures.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 89\u201390.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n&lt;gallery widths=&quot;200px&quot; heights=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;\nFile:Narmer Palette, Egypt, c. 3100 BC - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC09726.JPG|[[Facsimile]] of the [[Narmer Palette]], c. 3100 BCE, which already shows the canonical Egyptian profile view and proportions of the figure\nFile:King Menkaura (Mycerinus) and queen.jpg|[[Menkaura]] (Mycerinus) and queen, Old Kingdom, Dynasty 4, 2490\u20132472 BCE.

Most typical is a standing pose with arms crossed in front, but other figures are shown in different poses, including a complicated figure of a harpist seated on a chair.&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:Category:Getty Villa - Harp player - inv. 85.AA.103|images of Getty Villa 85.AA.103]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe subsequent [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] cultures developed sculpture further, under influence from Syria and elsewhere, but it is in the later [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] from around 650 BCE that the [[kouros]] developed. These are large standing statues of naked youths, found in temples and tombs, with the [[Kore (sculpture)|kore]] as the clothed female equivalent, with elaborately dressed hair; both have the &quot;[[archaic smile]]&quot;. They seem to have served a number of functions, perhaps sometimes representing deities and sometimes the person buried in a grave, as with the [[Kroisos Kouros]]. They are clearly influenced by Egyptian and Syrian styles, but the Greek artists were much more ready to experiment within the style.\n\nDuring the 6th century Greek sculpture developed rapidly, becoming more naturalistic, and with much more active and varied figure poses in narrative scenes, though still within idealized conventions. Sculptured [[pediment]]s were added to [[Greek temple|temples]], including the [[Parthenon]] in Athens, where the remains of the pediment of around 520 using figures in the round were fortunately used as infill for new buildings after the Persian sack in 480 BCE, and recovered from the 1880s on in fresh unweathered condition. Other significant remains of architectural sculpture come from [[Paestum]] in Italy, [[Corfu]], [[Delphi]] and the [[Temple of Aphaea]] in [[Aegina]] (much now in [[Munich]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 72, 85\u2013109; Boardman, 47\u201359&lt;/ref&gt;  Most Greek sculpture originally included at least some colour; the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek|Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek Museum]] in Copenhagen, Denmark, has done extensive research and recreation of the original colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.glyptoteket.com/about-the-museum/research/|title=Research |work=Glyptoteket|access-date=September 23, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trackingcolour.com|title=Tracking Colour|website=www.trackingcolour.com|access-date=September 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n&lt;gallery widths=&quot;200px&quot; heights=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;\nFile:Head figurine Spedos Louvre Ma2709.jpg|Cycladic statue 2700\u20132300 BCE.

The Severe style lasted from around 500 in reliefs, and soon after 480 in statues, to about 450. The relatively rigid poses of figures relaxed, and asymmetrical turning positions and oblique views became common, and deliberately sought. This was combined with a better understanding of anatomy and the harmonious structure of sculpted figures, and the pursuit of naturalistic representation as an aim, which had not been present before. Excavations at the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia]] since 1829 have revealed the largest group of remains, from about 460, of which many are in the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 109\u201319; Boardman, 87\u201395.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe &quot;High Classical&quot; period lasted only a few decades from about 450 to 400, but has had a momentous influence on art, and retains a special prestige, despite a very restricted number of original survivals. The best known works are the [[Parthenon Marbles]], traditionally (since [[Plutarch]]) executed by a team led by the most famous ancient Greek sculptor [[Phidias]], active from about 465\u2013425, who was in his own day more famous for his colossal [[Chryselephantine sculpture|chryselephantine]] [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]] (c. 432), one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], his ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'' (438), the cult image of the [[Parthenon]], and ''[[Athena Promachos]]'', a colossal bronze figure that stood next to the Parthenon; all of these are lost but are known from many representations. He is also credited as the creator of some life-size bronze statues known only from later copies whose identification is controversial, including the ''[[Hermes Ludovisi|Ludovisi Hermes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lapatin, Kenneth D.S., ''Phidias'', [[Oxford Art Online]], accessed August 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe High Classical style continued to develop realism and sophistication in the human figure, and improved the depiction of drapery (clothes), using it to add to the impact of active poses. Facial expressions were usually very restrained, even in combat scenes. The composition of groups of figures in reliefs and on pediments combined complexity and harmony in a way that had a permanent influence on Western art. Relief could be very high indeed, as in the Parthenon illustration below, where most of the leg of the warrior is completely detached from the background, as were the missing parts; relief this high made sculptures more subject to damage.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 119\u201331.&lt;/ref&gt; The Late Classical style developed the free-standing female nude statue, supposedly an innovation of [[Praxiteles]], and developed increasingly complex and subtle poses that were interesting when viewed from a number of angles, as well as more expressive faces; both trends were to be taken much further in the Hellenistic period.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 131\u201341.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=====Hellenistic=====\n[[File:Fregio della gigantomachia 02.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The Pergamene style of the Hellenistic period, from the [[Pergamon Altar]], early 2nd century]]\n\nThe [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic period]] is conventionally dated from the death of [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BCE, and ending either with the final conquest of the Greek heartlands by [[Roman Republic|Rome]] in 146 BCE or with the final defeat of the last remaining successor-state to Alexander's empire after the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BCE, which also marks the end of [[Republican Rome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;Alexander The Great and the Hellenistic Age, p. xiii. Green P. {{ISBN|978-0-7538-2413-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thus much longer than the previous periods, and includes at least two major phases: a &quot;Pergamene&quot; style of experimentation, exuberance and some sentimentality and vulgarity, and in the 2nd century BCE a classicising return to a more austere simplicity and elegance; beyond such generalizations dating is typically very uncertain, especially when only later copies are known, as is usually the case. The initial Pergamene style was not especially associated with [[Pergamon]], from which it takes its name, but the very wealthy kings of that state were among the first to collect and also copy Classical sculpture, and also commissioned much new work, including the famous [[Pergamon Altar]] whose sculpture is now mostly in Berlin and which exemplifies the new style, as do the   [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]] (another of the Seven Wonders), the famous ''[[Laoco\u00f6n and his Sons]]'' in the [[Vatican Museums]], a late example, and the bronze original of ''[[The Dying Gaul]]'' (illustrated at top), which we know was part of a group actually commissioned for Pergamon in about 228 BCE, from which the [[Ludovisi Gaul]] was also a copy. The group called the [[Farnese Bull]], possibly a 2nd-century marble original, is still larger and more complex,&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 142\u201356.&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[File:Tanagra o corinto, figura di donna seduta, 325-150 ac ca. 11.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Small [[Greek terracotta figurines]] were very popular as ornaments in the home]]\n\nHellenistic sculpture greatly expanded the range of subjects represented, partly as a result of greater general prosperity, and the emergence of a very wealthy class who had large houses decorated with sculpture, although we know that some examples of subjects that seem best suited to the home, such as children with animals, were in fact placed in temples or other public places. For a much more popular home decoration market there were [[Tanagra figurine]]s, and those from other centres where small pottery figures were produced on an industrial scale, some religious but others showing animals and elegantly dressed ladies. Sculptors became more technically skilled in representing facial expressions conveying a wide variety of emotions and the portraiture of individuals, as well representing different ages and races. The reliefs from the Mausoleum are rather atypical in that respect; most work was free-standing, and group compositions with several figures to be seen in the round, like the ''Laocoon'' and the Pergamon group celebrating victory over the Gauls became popular, having been rare before. The [[Barberini Faun]], showing a [[satyr]] sprawled asleep, presumably after drink, is an example of the moral relaxation of the period, and the readiness to create large and expensive sculptures of subjects that fall short of the heroic.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 142\u201354.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter the conquests of Alexander [[Hellenistic culture]] was dominant in the courts of most of the Near East, and some of [[Central Asia]], and increasingly being adopted by European elites, especially in Italy, where [[Magna Graecia|Greek colonies]] initially controlled most of the South. Hellenistic art, and artists, spread very widely, and was especially influential in the expanding Roman Republic and when it encountered Buddhism in the easternmost extensions of the Hellenistic area. The massive so-called [[Alexander Sarcophagus]] found in [[Sidon]] in modern Lebanon, was probably made there at the start of the period by expatriate Greek artists for a Hellenized Persian governor.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 155\u201358.&lt;/ref&gt;  The wealth of the period led to a greatly increased production of luxury forms of small sculpture, including [[engraved gem]]s and cameos, jewellery, and gold and silverware.\n\n&lt;gallery widths=&quot;200px&quot; heights=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;\nFile:Reggio calabria museo nazionale bronzi di riace.jpg|The [[Riace Bronzes]], very rare bronze figures recovered from the sea, c. 460\u2013430\nFile:Hermes and the infant Dionysus by Praxiteles.jpg|''[[Hermes and the Infant Dionysos]]'', possibly an original by [[Praxiteles]], 4th century\nFile:Italia del sud, due statuette femminili dolenti, 350-300 ac. ca.JPG|Two elegant ladies, pottery figurines, 350\u2013300\nFile:Bronze statuette of a horse MET DP120125.jpg|''Bronze Statuette of a Horse,'' late 2nd \u2013 1st century BCE [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\nFile:Nike of Samothrake Louvre Ma2369 n4.jpg|''The [[Winged Victory of Samothrace]]'', c. 190 BCE, [[Louvre]]\nFile:Venus de Milo Louvre Ma399 n4.jpg|''[[Venus de Milo]]'', c. 130\u2013100 BCE, [[Culture of Greece|Greek]], the [[Louvre]]\nFile:Laocoon Pio-Clementino Inv1059-1064-1067.jpg|''[[Laoco\u00f6n and his Sons]]'', Greek, (Late [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]]), perhaps a copy, between 200 BCE and 20 CE, [[white marble]], [[Vatican Museum]]\nFile:0 Apollon du Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re - Cortile Ottagono - Museo Pio-Clementino - Vatican (2).JPG|[[Leochares]], ''[[Apollo Belvedere]]'', c. 130\u2013140 CE.

An Etruscan speciality was near life size tomb effigies in [[terracotta]], usually lying on top of a [[sarcophagus]] lid propped up on one elbow in the pose of a diner in that period. As the expanding [[Roman Republic]] began to conquer Greek territory, at first in Southern Italy and then the entire Hellenistic world except for the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] far east, official and [[Roman patrician|patrician]] sculpture became largely an extension of the Hellenistic style, from which specifically Roman elements are hard to disentangle, especially as so much Greek sculpture survives only in copies of the Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 58\u201363; Hennig, 66\u201369.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 2nd century BCE, &quot;most of the sculptors working at Rome&quot; were Greek,&lt;ref&gt;Hennig, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; often enslaved in conquests such as that of [[Corinth]] (146 BCE), and sculptors continued to be mostly Greeks, often slaves, whose names are very rarely recorded. Vast numbers of Greek statues were imported to Rome, whether as booty or the result of extortion or commerce, and temples were often decorated with re-used Greek works.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 66\u201369; Strong, 36\u201339, 48; At the trial of [[Verres]], former governor of Sicily, [[Cicero]]'s prosecution details his depredations of art collections at great length.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nA native Italian style can be seen in the tomb monuments, which very often featured portrait busts, of prosperous middle-class Romans, and [[Roman portraiture|portraiture]] is arguably the main strength of Roman sculpture. There are no survivals from the tradition of masks of ancestors that were worn in processions at the funerals of the great families and otherwise displayed in the home, but many of the busts that survive must represent ancestral figures, perhaps from the large family tombs like the [[Tomb of the Scipios]] or the later mausolea outside the city. The famous bronze head supposedly of [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] is very variously dated, but taken as a very rare survival of Italic style under the Republic, in the preferred medium of bronze.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 23\u201324.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly stern and forceful heads are seen on coins of the Late Republic, and in the Imperial period coins as well as busts sent around the Empire to be placed in the [[basilica]]s of provincial cities were the main visual form of imperial propaganda; even [[Londinium]] had a near-colossal statue of [[Nero]], though far smaller than the 30-metre-high [[Colossus of Nero]] in Rome, now lost.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 66\u201371.&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[File:Ara Pacis Relief Pax.jpg|thumb|left|[[Augustus|Augustan]] state Greco-Roman style on the [[Ara Pacis]], 13 BCE]]\n\nThe Romans did not generally attempt to compete with free-standing Greek works of heroic exploits from history or mythology, but from early on produced historical works in relief, culminating in the great [[Roman triumphal column]]s with continuous narrative reliefs winding around them, of which those commemorating [[Trajan's Column|Trajan]] (CE 113) and [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|Marcus Aurelius]] (by 193) survive in Rome, where the [[Ara Pacis]] (&quot;Altar of Peace&quot;, 13 BCE) represents the official Greco-Roman style at its most classical and refined. Among other major examples are the earlier re-used reliefs on the [[Arch of Constantine]] and the base of the [[Column of Antoninus Pius]] (161),&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 73\u201382; Strong, 48\u201352, 80\u201383, 108\u201317, 128\u201332, 141\u201359, 177\u201382, 197\u2013211.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Campana relief]]s were cheaper pottery versions of marble reliefs and the taste for relief was from the imperial period expanded to the sarcophagus. All forms of luxury small sculpture continued to be patronized, and quality could be extremely high, as in the silver [[Warren Cup]], glass [[Lycurgus Cup]], and large cameos like the [[Gemma Augustea]], [[Gonzaga Cameo]] and the &quot;[[Great Cameo of France]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, Chapter 6; Strong, 303\u201315.&lt;/ref&gt;  For a much wider section of the population, moulded relief decoration of [[Ancient Roman pottery|pottery vessels]] and small figurines were produced in great quantity and often considerable quality.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, Chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter moving through a late 2nd-century &quot;baroque&quot; phase,&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 171\u201376, 211\u201314.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 3rd century, Roman art largely abandoned, or simply became unable to produce, sculpture in the classical tradition, a change whose causes remain much discussed. Even the most important imperial monuments now showed stumpy, large-eyed figures in a harsh frontal style, in simple compositions emphasizing power at the expense of grace. The contrast is famously illustrated in the [[Arch of Constantine]] of 315 in Rome, which combines sections in the new style with [[roundel]]s in the earlier full Greco-Roman style taken from elsewhere, and the ''[[Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs|Four Tetrarchs]]'' (c. 305) from the new capital of [[Constantinople]], now in Venice. [[Ernst Kitzinger]] found in both monuments the same &quot;stubby proportions, angular movements, an ordering of parts through symmetry and repetition and a rendering of features and drapery folds through incisions rather than modelling... The hallmark of the style wherever it appears consists of an emphatic hardness, heaviness and angularity\u2014in short, an almost complete rejection of the classical tradition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 9 (both quotes), more generally his Ch 1; Strong, 250\u201357, 264\u201366, 272\u201380.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThis revolution in style shortly preceded the period in which [[Christianity]] was adopted by the Roman state and the great majority of the people, leading to the end of large religious sculpture, with large statues now only used for emperors. However, rich Christians continued to commission reliefs for sarcophagi, as in the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]], and very small sculpture, especially in ivory, was continued by Christians, building on the style of the [[consular diptych]].&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 287\u201391, 305\u201308, 315\u201318; Henig, 234\u201340.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n&lt;gallery widths=&quot;200px&quot; heights=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;\nFile:Museo archeologico di Firenze, coperchio di sepolcro muliebre da Tuscania, terracotta con tracce di policromia III sec. d.c.JPG|[[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] [[sarcophagus]], 3rd century BCE\nFile:Capitoline Brutus Musei Capitolini MC1183 02.jpg|The &quot;[[Capitoline Brutus]]&quot;, dated to the 3rd or 1st century BCE\nFile:Statue-Augustus.jpg|''[[Augustus of Prima Porta]]'', statue of the emperor [[Augustus]], 1st century CE.

The first great example of the revival of large sculpture]]\nThe [[Early Christian]]s were opposed to monumental religious sculpture, though continuing Roman traditions in portrait busts and [[sarcophagus]] reliefs, as well as smaller objects such as the consular diptych. Such objects, often in valuable materials, were also the main sculptural traditions (as far as is known) of the [[barbaric civilization]]s of the [[Migration period]], as seen in the objects found in the 6th-century burial treasure at [[Sutton Hoo]], and the jewellery of [[Scythian art]] and the hybrid Christian and [[animal style]] productions of [[Insular art]]. Following the continuing Byzantine tradition, [[Carolingian art]] revived ivory carving, often in panels for the [[treasure binding]]s of grand [[illuminated manuscript]]s, as well as [[crozier]] heads and other small fittings.\n\n[[Byzantine art]], though producing superb ivory reliefs and architectural decorative carving, never returned to monumental sculpture, or even much small sculpture in the round.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 12, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the West during the [[Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian]] periods there was the beginnings of a production of monumental statues, in courts and major churches. This gradually spread; by the late 10th and 11th century there are records of several apparently life-size sculptures in [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] churches, probably of precious metal around a wooden frame, like the [[Golden Madonna of Essen]]. No Anglo-Saxon example has survived,&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and survivals of large non-architectural sculpture from before 1,000 are exceptionally rare. Much the finest is the [[Gero Cross]], of 965\u2013970, which is a [[crucifix]], which was evidently the commonest type of sculpture; [[Charlemagne]] had set one up in the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]] around 800. These continued to grow in popularity, especially in Germany and Italy. The [[rune stone]]s of the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] world, the [[Pictish stone]]s of Scotland and possibly the [[high cross]] reliefs of Christian Great Britain, were northern sculptural traditions that bridged the period of Christianization.\n\n&lt;gallery widths=&quot;200px&quot; heights=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;\nFile:Byzantine ivory 801.jpg|''[[Archangel Ivory]]'', 525\u2013550, [[Constantinople]]\nFile:Saint Remigius binding Medieval Picardie Museum.jpg|Late [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] ivory panel, probably meant for a book-cover\nFile:Triptych Harbaville Louvre OA3247 recto.jpg|The [[Harbaville Triptych]], [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] [[ivory]], mid-10th century\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n=====Romanesque=====\n{{main|Romanesque art}}\n[[File:Braunschweiger L\u00f6we, original in the Dankwarderode Castle - Braunschweig, Germany - DSC04562.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Brunswick Lion]], 1166, the first large hollow casting of a figure since antiquity, 1.78 metres tall and 2.79 metres long]]\n\nFrom about 1000 there was a general rebirth of artistic production in all Europe, led by general economic growth in production and commerce, and the new style of [[Romanesque art]] was the first medieval style to be used in the whole of Western Europe. The new cathedrals and pilgrim's churches were increasingly decorated with architectural stone reliefs, and new focuses for sculpture developed, such as the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over church doors in the 12th century, and the inhabited [[Capital (architecture)#Romanesque and Gothic capitals|capital]] with figures and often narrative scenes. Outstanding abbey churches with sculpture include in France [[Abbey of la Madaleine, V\u00e9zelay|V\u00e9zelay]] and [[Moissac Abbey|Moissac]] and in Spain [[Abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos|Silos]].&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 79\u201380, 90\u2013102.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nRomanesque art was characterised by a very vigorous style in both sculpture and painting. The capitals of columns were never more exciting than in this period, when they were often carved with complete scenes with several figures.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 107\u201314.&lt;/ref&gt;  The large wooden [[crucifix]] was a German innovation right at the start of the period, as were free-standing statues of the enthroned Madonna, but the [[high relief]] was above all the sculptural mode of the period. Compositions usually had little depth, and needed to be flexible to squeeze themselves into the shapes of capitals, and church typanums; the tension between a tightly enclosing frame, from which the composition sometimes escapes, is a recurrent theme in Romanesque art. Figures still often varied in size in relation to their importance portraiture hardly existed.\n\nObjects in precious materials such as ivory and metal had a very high status in the period, much more so than monumental sculpture \u2014 we know the names of more makers of these than painters, illuminators or architect-masons. Metalwork, including decoration in [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], became very sophisticated, and many spectacular shrines made to hold relics have survived, of which the best known is the [[Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral]] by [[Nicholas of Verdun]]. The bronze [[Gloucester candlestick]] and the [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Li\u00e8ge|brass font of 1108\u201317 now in Li\u00e8ge]] are superb examples, very different in style, of metal casting, the former highly intricate and energetic, drawing on manuscript painting, while the font shows the Mosan style at its most classical and majestic. The bronze doors, a triumphal column and other fittings at [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Hildesheim|Hildesheim Cathedral]], the [[Gniezno Doors]], and the doors of the [[Basilica di San Zeno]] in [[Verona]] are other substantial survivals. The [[aquamanile]], a container for water to wash with, appears to have been introduced to Europe in the 11th century, and often took fantastic [[zoomorphic]] forms; surviving examples are mostly in brass. Many wax impressions from impressive seals survive on charters and documents, although Romanesque coins are generally not of great aesthetic interest.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 115\u201332.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe [[Cloisters Cross]] is an unusually large [[ivory]] [[crucifix]], with complex carving including many figures of [[prophet]]s and others, which has been attributed to one of the relatively few artists whose name is known, [[Master Hugo]], who also illuminated manuscripts. Like many pieces it was originally partly coloured. The [[Lewis chessmen]] are well-preserved examples of small ivories, of which many pieces or fragments remain from [[crozier]]s, plaques, [[pectoral cross]]es and similar objects.\n\n&lt;gallery widths=&quot;200px&quot; heights=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;\nFile:Renier de Huy JPG0.jpg|[[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Li\u00e8ge]], ''[[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]]'', 1107\u201318\nFile:02 Basilique Ste-Marie-Madeleine de V\u00e9zelay - Tympan.jpg|The tympanum of [[V\u00e9zelay Abbey]], [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], France, 1130s\nFile:Cathedral of Ourense (Spain).jpg|''Facade,'' Cathedral of [[Ourense]] 1160, Spain\nFile:Ap\u00f3stoles del P\u00f3rtico de la Gloria.jpg|''P\u00f3rtico da Gloria'', [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Spain, c. 12th\u201313th centuries\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n===== Gothic =====\n{{main|Gothic art}}\n[[File:Vierge a l'Enfant debout.jpg|thumb|French ivory Virgin and Child, end of 13th century, 25 cm high, curving to fit the shape of the ivory tusk]]\n\nThe Gothic period is essentially defined by [[Gothic architecture]], and does not entirely fit with the development of style in sculpture in either its start or finish. The facades of large churches, especially around doors, continued to have large typanums, but also rows of sculpted figures spreading around them. The statues on the Western (Royal) Portal at [[Chartres Cathedral]] (c. 1145) show an elegant but exaggerated columnar elongation, but those on the south [[transept]] portal, from 1215 to 1220, show a more naturalistic style and increasing detachment from the wall behind, and some awareness of the classical tradition. These trends were continued in the west portal at [[Reims Cathedral]] of a few years later, where the figures are almost in the round, as became usual as Gothic spread across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Honour and Fleming, 297\u2013300; Henderson, 55, 82\u201384.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn Italy [[Nicola Pisano]] (1258\u20131278) and his son [[Giovanni Pisano|Giovanni]] developed a style that is often called [[Proto-Renaissance]], with unmistakable influence from Roman sarcophagi and sophisticated and crowded compositions, including a sympathetic handling of nudity, in relief panels on their [[Pulpit (Siena Cathedral)|pulpit of Siena Cathedral (1265\u201368)]], the [[Fontana Maggiore]] in [[Perugia]], and Giovanni's [[Pulpit by Giovanni Pisano in Sant'Andrea, Pistoia|pulpit in Pistoia]] of 1301.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 11\u201324; Honour and Fleming, 304; Henderson, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another revival of classical style is seen in the [[International Gothic]] work of [[Claus Sluter]] and his followers in [[Burgundy (historical region)|Burgundy]] and [[Flanders]] around 1400.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 65\u201369.&lt;/ref&gt;  Late Gothic sculpture continued in the North, with a fashion for very large wooden sculpted altarpieces with increasingly virtuoso carving and large numbers agitated expressive figures; most surviving examples are in Germany, after much iconoclasm elsewhere. [[Tilman Riemenschneider]], [[Veit Stoss]] and others continued the style well into the 16th century, gradually absorbing Italian Renaissance influences.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 305\u201311.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLife-size tomb effigies in stone or [[alabaster]] became popular for the wealthy, and grand multi-level tombs evolved, with the [[Scaliger Tombs]] of [[Verona]] so large they had to be moved outside the church. By the 15th century there was an industry exporting [[Nottingham alabaster]] altar reliefs in groups of panels over much of Europe for economical parishes who could not afford stone retables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/bbchistory/object_text07.htm] [[V&amp;A Museum]]&lt;span&gt; feature on the Nottingham alabaster &lt;/span&gt;''Swansea Altarpiece''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Small carvings, for a mainly lay and often female market, became a considerable industry in Paris and some other centres. Types of ivories included small devotional [[polyptych]]s, [[Virgin and Child from the Sainte-Chapelle|single figures, especially of the Virgin]], mirror-cases, combs, and [[Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)|elaborate caskets with scenes from Romances]], used as engagement presents.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 193\u201398.&lt;/ref&gt;  The very wealthy collected extravagantly elaborate jewelled and enamelled metalwork, both secular and religious, like the [[Duc de Berry]]'s [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]], until they ran short of money, when they were melted down again for cash.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, 25\u201348; Henderson, 134\u201341.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n&lt;gallery widths=&quot;200px&quot; heights=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;\nFile:Chartres2006 077.jpg|West portal of [[Chartres Cathedral]] (c. 1145)\nFile:Chartres cathedral 023 martyrs S TTaylor.JPG|South portal of [[Chartres Cathedral]] (c. 1215\u20131220)\nFile:Reims6.jpg|West portal at [[Reims Cathedral]], [[Annunciation]] group\nFile:Pisa.Baptistery.pulpit02.jpg|[[Nicola Pisano]], ''Nativity'' and ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'' from the pulpit of the [[Pisa Baptistery]]\nFile:Bamberger Dom-Bamberger Reiter.JPG|The [[Bamberg Horseman]] 1237, near life-size stone [[equestrian statue]], the first of this kind since [[antiquities|antiquity]].\nFile:French - Casket with Scenes of Romances - Walters 71264 - Top.jpg|Lid of the [[Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)|Walters Casket]], with the ''Siege of the Castle of Love'' at left, and [[jousting]].

Ghiberti's doors are still in place, but were undoubtedly eclipsed by his second pair for the other entrance, the so-called ''Gates of Paradise'', which took him from 1425 to 1452, and are dazzlingly confident classicizing compositions with varied depths of relief allowing extensive backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 41\u201346, 62\u201363.&lt;/ref&gt; The intervening years had seen Ghiberti's early assistant [[Donatello]] develop with seminal statues including his ''[[David (Donatello)|Davids]]'' in marble (1408\u201309) and bronze (1440s), and his [[Equestrian statue of Gattamelata]], as well as reliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 45\u201352, and see index.&lt;/ref&gt; A leading figure in the later period was [[Andrea del Verrocchio]], best known for his [[equestrian statue]] of [[Bartolomeo Colleoni]] in Venice;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 114\u201318, 149\u201350.&lt;/ref&gt; his pupil [[Leonardo da Vinci]] designed an equine sculpture in 1482 ''[[Leonardo's horse|The Horse]]'' for [[Milan]]-but only succeeded in making a {{convert|24|ft|m|adj=on}} clay model which was destroyed by French archers in 1499, and his other ambitious sculptural plans were never completed.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 149\u201350.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe period was marked by a great increase in patronage of sculpture by the state for public art and by the wealthy for their homes; especially in Italy, public sculpture remains a crucial element in the appearance of historic city centres. Church sculpture mostly moved inside just as outside public monuments became common. Portrait sculpture, usually in busts, became popular in Italy around 1450, with the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] [[Francesco Laurana]] specializing in young women in meditative poses, while [[Antonio Rossellino]] and others more often depicted knobbly-faced men of affairs, but also young children.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 103\u201310, 131\u201332.&lt;/ref&gt;  The portrait [[medal]] invented by [[Pisanello]] also often depicted women; relief [[plaquette]]s were another new small form of sculpture in cast metal.\n\nMichelangelo was an active sculptor from about 1500 to 1520, and his great masterpieces including his ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', ''[[Pieta (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]]'', ''[[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses]]'', and pieces for the [[Tomb of Pope Julius II]] and [[Medici Chapel]] could not be ignored by subsequent sculptors. His iconic David (1504) has a ''[[contrapposto]]'' pose, borrowed from classical sculpture. It differs from previous representations of the subject in that David is depicted before his battle with Goliath and not after the giant's defeat. Instead of being shown victorious, as Donatello and Verocchio had done, David looks tense and battle ready.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Chapter 8, 179\u201381.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n&lt;gallery widths=&quot;200px&quot; heights=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;\nFile:Ghiberti-porta.jpg|[[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], panel of the ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac]]'' from the [[Florence Baptistry]] doors; [[:File:Abraham (Gates of Paradise) 01.JPG|oblique view here]]\nFile:Cantoria Della Robbia OPA Florence 6.jpg|[[Luca della Robbia]], detail of ''Cantoria'', c. 1438, [[Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Florence)|Museo dell'Opera del Duomo]], Florence\nFile:Florence - David by Donatello.jpg|[[Donatello]], ''[[David (Donatello)|David]]'' c. 1440s, [[Bargello Museum]], [[Florence]]\nFile:Firenze.PalVecchio.Donatello.JPG|[[Donatello]], ''[[Judith and Holofernes (Donatello)|Judith and Holofernes]]'', c. 1460, [[Palazzo Vecchio]], [[Florence]]\nFile:Francesco Laurana pushkin.jpg|[[Francesco Laurana]], female bust (cast)\nFile:Verrochioorsanmichelle.jpg|[[Verrocchio]], ''[[Christ and St. Thomas (Verrocchio)|Doubting Thomas]]'', 1467\u20131483, [[Orsanmichele]], [[Florence]]\nFile:Michelangelos David.jpg|[[Michelangelo]], ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', c. 1504, [[Galleria dell'Accademia]], [[Florence]]\nFile:Dying slave Louvre MR 1590.jpg|[[Michelangelo]], ''[[Dying Slave]]'', c. 1513\u20131516\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n====Mannerist====\n[[File:Devries-mercuriocrop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Adriaen de Vries]], ''Mercury and Psyche'' [[Northern Mannerist]] life-size bronze, made in 1593 for [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]].]]\n{{main|Mannerism}}\nAs in painting, early Italian [[Mannerist]] sculpture was very largely an attempt to find an original style that would top the achievement of the [[High Renaissance]], which in sculpture essentially meant Michelangelo, and much of the struggle to achieve this was played out in commissions to fill other places in the [[Piazza della Signoria]] in Florence, next to Michelangelo's ''David''. [[Baccio Bandinelli]] took over the project of ''[[Hercules and Cacus]]'' from the master himself, but it was little more popular than it is now, and maliciously compared by [[Benvenuto Cellini]] to &quot;a sack of melons&quot;, though it had a long-lasting effect in apparently introducing relief panels on the [[pedestal]] of statues. Like other works of his and other Mannerists it removes far more of the original block than Michelangelo would have done.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 179\u201382.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cellini's bronze ''[[Perseus with the head of Medusa]]'' is certainly a masterpiece, designed with eight angles of view, another Mannerist characteristic, but is indeed mannered compared to the ''David''s of Michelangelo and Donatello.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 183\u201387.&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally a goldsmith, his famous gold and enamel [[Cellini Salt Cellar|Salt Cellar]] (1543) was his first sculpture, and shows his talent at its best.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 182\u201383.&lt;/ref&gt;  As these examples show, the period extended the range of secular subjects for large works beyond portraits, with mythological figures especially favoured; previously these had mostly been found in small works.\n\nSmall bronze figures for collector's [[Cabinet (room)|cabinets]], often mythological subjects with nudes, were a popular Renaissance form at which [[Giambologna]], originally [[Flemish]] but based in Florence, excelled in the later part of the century, also creating life-size sculptures, of which two joined the collection in the Piazza della Signoria. He and his followers devised elegant elongated examples of the ''[[figura serpentinata]]'', often of two intertwined figures, that were interesting from all angles.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 194\u2013202.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n&lt;gallery widths=&quot;200px&quot; heights=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;\nFile:Fontainebleau escalier roi.jpg|[[Stucco]] [[overdoor]] at [[palace of Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]], probably designed by [[Primaticcio]], who painted the oval inset, 1530s or 1540s\nFile:Persee-florence.jpg|[[Benvenuto Cellini]], ''[[Perseus with the head of Medusa]]'', 1545\u20131554\nFile:Samson slaying a philistine.jpg|[[Giambologna]], ''[[Samson Slaying a Philistine]]'', about 1562\nFile:Giambologna raptodasabina.jpg|[[Giambologna]], ''[[The Rape of the Sabine Women]]'', 1583, Florence, Italy, 13' 6&quot; (4.1&amp;nbsp;m) high, [[marble]]\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n====Baroque and Rococo====\n{{main|Baroque sculpture}}\n[[File:Apollo and Daphne (Bernini).jpg|thumb|[[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], ''[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]'' in the [[Galleria Borghese]], 1622\u20131625]]\nIn Baroque sculpture, groups of figures assumed new importance, and there was a dynamic movement and energy of human forms\u2014 they spiralled around an empty central vortex, or reached outwards into the surrounding space. Baroque sculpture often had multiple ideal viewing angles, and reflected a general continuation of the Renaissance move away from the relief to sculpture created in the round, and designed to be placed in the middle of a large space\u2014elaborate fountains such as Bernini's [[Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi]] (Rome, 1651), or those in the [[Gardens of Versailles]] were a Baroque speciality. The [[Baroque]] style was perfectly suited to sculpture, with [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] the dominating figure of the age in works such as ''[[The Ecstasy of St Theresa]]'' (1647\u20131652).&lt;ref&gt;Boucher, 134\u201342 on the [[Cornaro chapel]]; see index for Bernini generally.&lt;/ref&gt; Much Baroque sculpture added extra-sculptural elements, for example, concealed lighting, or water fountains, or fused sculpture and architecture to create a transformative experience for the viewer. Artists saw themselves as in the classical tradition, but admired [[Hellenistic]] and later Roman sculpture, rather than that of the more &quot;Classical&quot; periods as they are seen today.&lt;ref&gt;Boucher, 16\u201318.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation]] brought an almost total stop to religious sculpture in much of Northern Europe, and though secular sculpture, especially for portrait busts and [[tomb monument]]s, continued, the [[Dutch Golden Age]] has no significant sculptural component outside goldsmithing.&lt;ref&gt;Honour and Fleming, 450.&lt;/ref&gt;  Partly in direct reaction, sculpture was as prominent in [[Roman Catholic church|Roman Catholicism]] as in the late Middle Ages. Statues of rulers and the nobility became increasingly popular. In the 18th century much sculpture continued on Baroque lines\u2014the [[Trevi Fountain]] was only completed in 1762. [[Rococo]] style was better suited to smaller works, and arguably found its ideal sculptural form in [[Ceramic art#Porcelain|early European porcelain]], and interior decorative schemes in wood or plaster such as those in French domestic interiors and [[Architecture of cathedrals and great churches#Rococo|Austrian and Bavarian pilgrimage churches]].&lt;ref&gt;Honour and Fleming, 460\u201367.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n&lt;gallery widths=&quot;180px&quot; heights=&quot;180px&quot; perrow=&quot;5&quot;&gt;\nFile:Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Dijon - Louis XIV 1.jpg|Bust of [[Louis XIV]], 1686, by [[Antoine Coysevox]]\nFile:Francesco Mochi Santa Ver\u00f3nica 1629-32 Vaticano.jpg|Saint Veronica by [[Francesco Mochi]] (1640), [[Saint Peter's Basilica]]\nFile:Perseus Andromeda Puget Louvre MR2076.jpg|[[Pierre Paul Puget]], ''Perseus and Andromeda'', 1715, [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]]\nFile:Bustelli Liebesgruppe Der gest\u00f6rte Schl\u00e4fer BNM.jpg|[[Franz Anton Bustelli]], [[Rococo]] [[Nymphenburg Porcelain]] group\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n====Neo-Classical====\n{{main|Neoclassical sculpture}}\n[[File:Psych\u00e9.jpg|thumb|[[Antonio Canova]]: ''[[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss|Psyche Revived by Love's Kiss]]'', 1787]]\nThe [[Neoclassical sculpture|Neoclassical style]] that arrived in the late 18th century gave great emphasis to sculpture. [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]] exemplifies the penetrating portrait sculpture the style could produce, and [[Antonio Canova]]'s nudes the idealist aspect of the movement. The Neoclassical period was one of the great ages of public sculpture, though its &quot;classical&quot; prototypes were more likely to be Roman copies of Hellenistic sculptures. In sculpture, the most familiar representatives are the Italian [[Antonio Canova]], the Englishman [[John Flaxman]] and the Dane [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]. The European neoclassical manner also took hold in the United States, where its pinnacle occurred somewhat later and is exemplified in the sculptures of [[Hiram Powers]].\n\n&lt;gallery widths=&quot;160px&quot; heights=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;\nFile:Benjamin Franklin (1706\u20131790) MET DT2883.jpg|[[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], ''Bust of [[Benjamin Franklin]]'', 1778, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\nFile:Jas\u00e3o e o Velo de ouro - Bertel Thorvaldsen - 1803.jpg|[[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]: ''[[Jason|Jason and the Golden Fleece]]'' (1803)\nFile:Badger church - Jane and Henrietta Browne.jpg|[[John Flaxman]], Memorial in the church at [[Badger, Shropshire]], c. 1780s\nFile:The Greek Slave.jpg|[[Hiram Powers]], 1851, ''[[The Greek Slave]]'', [[Yale University Art Gallery]]\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n===Asia===\n\n====Greco-Buddhist sculpture and Asia====\n[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|[[Standing Buddha (Tokyo National Museum)|One of the first representations]] of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], 1st\u20132nd century CE, [[Gandhara]]]]\n{{main|Greco-Buddhist art}}\n\n[[Greco-Buddhist art]] is the artistic manifestation of [[Greco-Buddhism]], a cultural [[syncretism]] between the [[Ancient Greece|Classical Greek]] culture and [[Buddhism]], which developed over a period of close to 1000 years in Central Asia, between the [[Wars of Alexander the Great|conquests of Alexander the Great]] in the 4th century BCE, and the Islamic conquests of the 7th century CE. Greco-Buddhist art is characterized by the strong idealistic realism of Hellenistic art and the first representations of the Buddha in human form, which have helped define the artistic (and particularly, sculptural) canon for Buddhist art throughout the Asian continent up to the present. Though dating is uncertain, it appears that strongly Hellenistic styles lingered in the East for several centuries after they had declined around the Mediterranean, as late as the 5th century CE. Some aspects of Greek art were adopted while others did not spread beyond the Greco-Buddhist area; in particular the standing figure, often with a relaxed pose and one leg flexed, and the flying cupids or victories, who became popular across Asia as [[apsara]]s. Greek foliage decoration was also influential, with Indian versions of the [[Corinthian capital]] appearing.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 370\u201378; Harle, 71\u201384.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe origins of Greco-Buddhist art are to be found in the Hellenistic [[Greco-Bactrian kingdom]] (250\u2013130 BCE), located in today's [[Afghanistan]], from which Hellenistic culture radiated into the [[Indian subcontinent]] with the establishment of the small [[Indo-Greek kingdom]] (180\u201310 BCE). Under the [[Indo-Greeks]] and then the [[Kushan]]s, the interaction of Greek and Buddhist culture flourished in the area of [[Gandhara]], in today's northern Pakistan, before spreading further into India, influencing the art of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], and then the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] art of the [[Gupta empire]], which was to extend to the rest of South-East Asia.

They are cast with complex patterned and [[zoomorphic]] decoration, but avoid the human figure, unlike the huge figures only recently discovered at [[Sanxingdui]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, Chapter 1, 135\u201336.&lt;/ref&gt;  The spectacular [[Terracotta Army]] was assembled for the tomb of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first emperor of a unified China from 221\u2013210 BCE, as a grand imperial version of the figures long placed in tombs to enable the deceased to enjoy the same lifestyle in the afterlife as when alive, replacing actual sacrifices of very early periods. Smaller figures in pottery or wood were placed in tombs for many centuries afterwards, reaching a peak of quality in [[Tang dynasty tomb figures]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 138\u201338.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tradition of unusually large pottery figures persisted in China, through Tang [[sancai]] tomb figures to later Buddhist statues such as the near life-size set of [[Yixian glazed pottery luohans]] and later figures for temples and tombs.  These came to replace earlier equivalents in wood.\n\nNative Chinese religions do not usually use cult images of deities, or even represent them, and large religious sculpture is nearly all Buddhist, dating mostly from the 4th to the 14th century, and initially using Greco-Buddhist models arriving via the [[Silk Road]]. Buddhism is also the context of all large portrait sculpture; in total contrast to some other areas, in medieval China even painted images of the emperor were regarded as private. Imperial tombs have spectacular avenues of approach lined with real and mythological animals on a scale matching Egypt, and smaller versions decorate temples and palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 135\u201345, 145\u201363.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSmall Buddhist figures and groups were produced to a very high quality in a range of media,&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 163\u201365&lt;/ref&gt; as was relief decoration of all sorts of objects, especially in metalwork and [[Chinese jade|jade]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, Chapters 4 and 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the earlier periods, large quantities of sculpture were cut from the living rock in pilgrimage cave-complexes, and as outside [[rock reliefs]].  These were mostly originally painted.  In notable contrast to [[Scholar-official|literati]] painters, sculptors of all sorts were regarded as artisans and very few names are recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;  From the [[Ming dynasty]] onwards, statuettes of religious and secular figures were produced in [[Chinese porcelain]] and other media, which became an important export.\n\n&lt;gallery widths=&quot;200px&quot; heights=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;\nFile:Liu Ding.jpg|A bronze [[ding (vessel)|ding]] from late [[Shang dynasty]] (13th century\u201310th century BCE)\nFile:Chinese tomb guardian 300 BC.jpg|A tomb guardian usually placed inside the doors of the tomb to protect or guide the soul, [[Warring States period]], c. 3rd century BCE\nFile:Soldier Horse.JPG|Lifesize calvalryman from the [[Terracotta Army]], [[Qin dynasty]], c. 3rd century BCE\nFile:Gold monster.jpg|Gold stag with eagle's head, [[Xiongnu]] tomb on the [[Mongolia]]n frontier, 4th\u20133rd century BCE\nFile:Nswag, dinastia han, figurina dipinta di danzatrice.jpg|Tomb figure of dancing girl, [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BCE\u2014220 CE)\nFile:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - bronze cowrie container.jpg|Bronze [[cowrie]] container with [[yak]]s, from the [[Dian Kingdom]] (4th century BCE \u2013 109 BCE) tradition of the [[Western Han]]\nFile:Wei-Maitreya.jpg|[[Northern Wei dynasty]] [[Maitreya]] (386\u2013534)\nFile:China Pferd und Pferdeknecht Linden-Museum.jpg|[[Tang dynasty tomb figure]] in ''[[sancai]]'' glaze pottery, horse and groom (618\u2013907)\nFile:Mahayanabuddha.jpg|Seated [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Tang dynasty]] c. 650.\nFile:Leshan da fo Flickr feet-head modified.jpg|The [[Leshan Giant Buddha]], [[Tang dynasty]], completed in 803.\nFile:Song-Bodhisattva1.jpg|A wooden [[Bodhisattva]] from the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279)\nFile:Chinese - Cup with Dragon Handles - Walters 42250 - Profile.jpg|[[Chinese jade]] Cup with Dragon Handles, [[Song dynasty]], 12th century\nFile:Bodhisattva Guanyin from Nantoy\u014ds\u014d Collection.jpg|[[Guanyin]] [[Bodhisattva]] in ''[[Blanc de Chine]] (Dehua porcelain)'', by [[He Chaozong]], [[Ming dynasty]], early 17th century\nFile:Man blowing conch (Wanli Reign Period).JPG|Blue underglaze statue of a man with his pipe, [[Jingdezhen porcelain]], Ming [[Wanli Emperor|Wanli period]] (1573\u20131620)\nFile:China - Beijing 12 - lion outside the Tibetan Monastery (134036069).jpg|A [[Chinese guardian lion]] outside [[Yonghe Temple]], Beijing, [[Qing dynasty]], c. 1694\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n====Japan====\n{{see also|Japanese art|Japanese sculpture|List of National Treasures of Japan (sculptures)}}\n[[File:NaraTodaijiDaibutsu0212.jpg|thumb|[[T\u014ddai-ji|Nara Daibutsu]], c. 752, [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], [[Japan]]]]\nTowards the end of the long [[Neolithic]] [[J\u014dmon period]], some [[J\u014dmon pottery|pottery vessels]] were &quot;flame-rimmed&quot; with extravagant extensions to the rim that can only be called sculptural,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbz.or.jp/eng/middlejomon.htm Middle Jomon Sub-Period] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525100233/http://www.nbz.or.jp/eng/middlejomon.htm |date=2009-05-25 }}, Niigata Prefectural Museum of History, accessed August 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and very stylized pottery [[dog\u016b]] figures were produced, many with the characteristic &quot;snow-goggle&quot; eyes. During the Kofun period of the 3rd to 6th century CE, [[haniwa]] terracotta figures of humans and animals in a simplistic style were erected outside important tombs. The arrival of Buddhism in the 6th century brought with it sophisticated traditions in sculpture, Chinese styles mediated via Korea. The 7th-century [[H\u014dry\u016b-ji]] and its contents have survived more intact than any East Asian Buddhist temple of its date, with works including a ''Shaka Trinity'' of 623 in bronze, showing the historical Buddha flanked by two bodhisattvas and also the [[Four Heavenly Kings|Guardian Kings of the Four Directions]].&lt;ref&gt;Paine &amp; Soper, 30\u201331.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe wooden image (9th century) of Shakyamuni, the &quot;historic&quot; Buddha, enshrined in a secondary building at the [[Mur\u014d-ji]], is typical of the early [[Heian period|Heian]] sculpture, with its ponderous body, covered by thick drapery folds carved in the hompa-shiki (rolling-wave) style, and its austere, withdrawn facial expression. The [[Kei school]] of sculptors, particularly [[Unkei]], created a new, more realistic style of sculpture.\n\nAlmost all subsequent significant large sculpture in Japan was Buddhist, with some [[Shinto]] equivalents, and after Buddhism declined in Japan in the 15th century, monumental sculpture became largely architectural decoration and less significant.&lt;ref&gt;Paine &amp; Soper, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;  However sculptural work in the decorative arts was developed to a remarkable level of technical achievement and refinement in small objects such as [[inro]] and [[netsuke]] in many materials, and metal ''{{lang|ja|tosogu}}'' or [[Japanese sword mountings]]. In the 19th century there were export industries of small bronze sculptures of extreme virtuosity, ivory and porcelain figurines, and other types of small sculpture, increasingly emphasizing technical accomplishment.\n\n&lt;gallery widths=&quot;200px&quot; heights=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;\nFile:Dogu Miyagi 1000 BCE 400 BCE.jpg|[[Dog\u016b]] with &quot;snow-goggle&quot; eyes, 1000\u2013400 BCE\nFile:Arte giapponese, nobile haniwa, VI sec.JPG|6th-century [[haniwa]] figure\nFile:Horyu-ji14s3200.jpg|Kongo Rishiki (Guardian Deity) at the Central Gate of [[H\u014dry\u016b-ji]]\nFile:Jianzhen (T\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji, 2).jpg|Priest [[Ganjin]] (Jianzhen), [[Nara period]], 8th century\nFile:Taishakuten \u015aakra, T\u014d-ji.jpg|Taishakuten [[\u015aakra (Buddhism)|\u015aakra]], 839, [[T\u014d-ji]]\nFile:Seated Dainichi Nyorai.jpg|[[Dainichi Nyorai (Enj\u014d-ji)|Dainichi Nyorai]] by [[Unkei]], 1176, at [[Enj\u014d-ji]]\nFile:Tsuchiya Yasuchika - Tsuba with a Rabbit Viewing the Autumn Moon - Walters 51163.jpg|[[Tsuba]] sword fitting with a &quot;Rabbit Viewing the Autumn Moon&quot;, bronze, gold and silver, between 1670 and 1744\nFile:Izumiya Tomotada - Netsuke in the Form of a Dog - Walters 711020 - Three Quarter.jpg|Izumiya Tomotada, [[netsuke]] in the form of a dog, late 18th century\nFile:Eagle, By Suzuki Chokichi Suzuki \u9234\u6728\u9577\u5409\u300c\u9df2\u7f6e\u7269\u300d.jpg|Eagle by Suzuki Chokichi, 1892, [[Tokyo National Museum]]\nFile:Yamada Ch\u00f6zabur\u00f6 - Wind God - Walters 52158.jpg|Yamada Ch\u014dzabur\u014d, ''Wind God'' in [[repouss\u00e9]] iron, c. 1915\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n==== India ====\n{{see also|Sculpture in South Asia|List of rock-cut temples in India|Sculpture of Bangladesh}}\n[[File:Met, india (uttar pradesh), gupta period, krishna battling the horse demon keshi, 5th century.JPG|thumb|Hindu [[Gupta art|Gupta]] [[terracotta]] relief, 5th century CE, of [[Krishna]] Killing the Horse Demon [[Keshi (demon)|Keshi]]]]\n\nThe first known [[sculpture in the Indian subcontinent]] is from the [[Indus Valley civilization]] (3300\u20131700 BCE), found in sites at [[Mohenjo-daro]] and [[Harappa]] in modern-day [[Pakistan]]. These include the famous small bronze female dancer. However, such figures in bronze and stone are rare and greatly outnumbered by pottery figurines and stone seals, often of animals or deities very finely depicted.

Carving is often highly detailed, with an intricate backing behind the main figure in high relief. The celebrated bronzes of the [[Chola]] dynasty (c. 850\u20131250) from south India, many designed to be carried in processions, include the iconic form of [[Shiva]] as [[Nataraja]],&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 301\u201310, 325\u201327&lt;/ref&gt; with the massive granite carvings of [[Mahabalipuram]] dating from the previous [[Pallava]] dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 276\u201384.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n&lt;gallery widths=&quot;200px&quot; heights=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;\nFile:Dancing Girl of Mohenjo-daro.jpg|The &quot;dancing girl of [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjo Daro]]&quot;, 3rd millennium BCE (replica)\nFile:Asokanpillar-crop.jpg|[[Pillars of Ashoka|Ashoka Pillar]], [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]], [[Bihar]], c. 250 BCE\nFile:Column, Sanchi.jpg|[[Stupa]] gateway at [[Sanchi]], c. 100 CE or perhaps earlier, with densely packed reliefs\nFile:Buddha from Sarnath.jpg|Buddha from [[Sarnath]], 5\u20136th century CE\nFile:Elephanta tourists.jpg|The Colossal [[trimurti]] at the [[Elephanta Caves]]\nFile:Ellora cave16 001.jpg|Rock-cut temples at [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]]\nFile:Shrine with Four Jinas (Rishabhanatha (Adinatha)), Parshvanatha, Neminatha, and Mahavira) LACMA M.85.55 (1 of 4).jpg|[[Jain]] shrine with [[Rishabhanatha]], [[Parshvanatha]], [[Neminatha]], and [[Mahavira]], 6th century\nFile:NatarajaMET.JPG|Hindu, [[Chola]] period, 1000\nFile:The Hindu deity Vishnu - Indian Art - Asian Art Museum of San Francisco.jpg|Typical medieval frontal standing statue of [[Vishnu]], 950\u20131150\nFile:Khajuraho8.jpg|[[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Khajuraho]] Temple\nFile:WLA lacma Celestial Nymph ca 1450 Rajasthan.jpg|Marble Sculpture of female [[yakshi]] in typical curving pose, c. 1450, [[Rajasthan]]\nFile:Natarajartemple1.jpg|[[Gopuram]] of the [[Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram]], [[Tamil Nadu]], densely packed with rows of painted statues\nFile:\u0d1c\u0d32\u0d17\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d27\u0d47\u0d36\u0d4d\u0d35\u0d30\u0d7c \u0d15\u0d4d\u0d37\u0d47\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d32\u0d46 \u0d26\u0d4d\u0d35\u0d3e\u0d30\u0d2a\u0d3e\u0d32\u0d15\u0d36\u0d3f\u0d32\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d02.JPG|Sculpture of Guardian at the entrance of the Mandapam of Sri Jalagandeeswarar Temple, Vellore, Tamil Nadu\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n====South-East Asia====\n[[File:Linteau Mus\u00e9e Guimet 1097 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|9th-century Khmer [[lintel]]]]\nThe sculpture of the region tends to be characterised by a high degree of ornamentation, as seen in the great monuments of Hindu and Buddhist [[Khmer sculpture]] (9th to 13th centuries) at [[Angkor Wat]] and elsewhere, the enormous 9th-century Buddhist complex at [[Borobudur]] in [[Java]], and the Hindu monuments of [[Bali]].&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 196\u2013200.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these include many reliefs as well as figures in the round; Borobudur has 2,672 relief panels, 504 Buddha statues, many semi-concealed in openwork [[stupa]]s, and many large guardian figures.\n\nIn Thailand and Laos, sculpture was mainly of [[Iconography of Gautama Buddha in Laos and Thailand|Buddha images]], often gilded, both large for temples and monasteries, and small figurines for private homes. Traditional sculpture in [[Myanmar]] emerged before the [[Pagan Kingdom|Bagan period]]. As elsewhere in the region, most of the wood sculptures of the Bagan and Ava periods have been lost. Traditional [[Philippine mythology|Anitist]] sculptures from the Philippines are dominated by Anitist designs mirroring the medium used and the culture involved, while being highlighted by the environments where such sculptures are usually placed on. Christian and Islamic sculptures from the Philippines have different motifs compared to other Christian and Islamic sculptures elsewhere.

In the very early [[Mshatta Facade]] (740s), now mostly in [[Berlin]], there are animals within the dense arabesques in high relief, and figures of animals and men in mostly low relief are found in conjunction with decoration on many later pieces in various materials, including metalwork, ivory and ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky and Rogers, 23, 26\u201327, 33\u201337.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nFigures of animals in the round were often acceptable for works used in private contexts if the object was clearly practical, so medieval Islamic art contains many metal animals that are [[aquamanile]]s, [[incense]] burners or supporters for fountains, as in the stone lions supporting the famous one in the [[Alhambra]], culminating in the largest medieval Islamic animal figure known, the [[Pisa Griffin]]. In the same way, luxury [[hardstone carving]]s such as dagger hilts and cups may be formed as animals, especially in [[Mughal art]]. The degree of acceptability of such relaxations of strict Islamic rules varies between periods and regions, with [[Islamic Spain]], Persia and India often leading relaxation, and is typically highest in courtly contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky and Rogers, 23, 33\u201337.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n&lt;gallery widths=&quot;200px&quot; heights=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;\nFile:Mschatta-Fassade (Pergamonmuseum).jpg|The [[Mshatta Facade]], from a palace near [[Damascus]], 740s\nFile:Arte islamica, ippogrifo, XI sec 02.JPG|The [[Pisa Griffin]], 107&amp;nbsp;cm high, probably 11th century\nFile:Turquoise epigraphic ornament MBA Lyon A1969-333.jpg|Part of a 15th-century ceramic panel from [[Samarkand]] with white calligraphy on a blue [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] background.\nFile:Dagger horse head Louvre OA7891.jpg|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] dagger with hilt in [[jade]], gold, [[rubies]] and [[emerald]]s.

Female (left) and male Vertical styles]]\nHistorically, with the exception of some monumental Egyptian sculpture, most African sculpture was created in wood and other organic materials that have not survived from earlier than a few centuries ago; older pottery figures are found from a number of areas. [[Traditional African masks|Masks]] are important elements in the art of many peoples, along with human figures, often highly stylized. There is a vast variety of styles, often varying within the same context of origin depending on the use of the object, but wide regional trends are apparent; sculpture is most common among &quot;groups of settled cultivators in the areas drained by the [[Niger]] and [[Congo river]]s&quot; in West Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Honour &amp; Fleming, 557&quot;&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 557.&lt;/ref&gt;  Direct images of deities are relatively infrequent, but masks in particular are or were often made for religious ceremonies; today many are made for tourists as &quot;airport art&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 559\u201361.&lt;/ref&gt;  African masks were an influence on European [[Modernism|Modernist]] art, which was inspired by their lack of concern for naturalistic depiction.\n\nThe [[Nubia]]n [[Kingdom of Kush]] in modern Sudan was in close and often hostile contact with Egypt, and produced monumental sculpture mostly derivative of styles to the north. In West Africa, the earliest known sculptures are from the [[Nok culture]] which thrived between 500 BCE and 500 CE in modern Nigeria, with clay figures typically with elongated bodies and angular shapes. Later West African cultures developed bronze casting for reliefs to decorate palaces like the famous [[Benin Bronzes]], and very fine naturalistic royal heads from around the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] town of [[Ife]] in terracotta and metal from the 12th\u201314th centuries. [[Akan goldweights]] are a form of small metal sculptures produced over the period 1400\u20131900, some apparently representing [[proverb]]s and so with a narrative element rare in African sculpture, and royal regalia included impressive gold sculptured elements.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 556\u201361.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nMany West African figures are used in religious rituals and are often coated with materials placed on them for ceremonial offerings. The [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mande]]-speaking peoples of the same region make pieces of wood with broad, flat surfaces and arms and legs are shaped like cylinders. In Central Africa, however, the main distinguishing characteristics include heart-shaped faces that are curved inward and display patterns of circles and dots.\n\nPopulations in the [[African Great Lakes]] are not known for their sculpture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Honour &amp; Fleming, 557&quot;/&gt; However, one style from the region is pole sculptures, carved in human shapes and decorated with geometric forms, while the tops are carved with figures of animals, people, and various objects. These poles are, then, placed next to graves and are associated with death and the ancestral world.

The most developed styles are those of the [[Northwest Coast art|Pacific Northwest Coast]], where a group of elaborate and highly stylized formal styles developed forming the basis of a tradition that continues today. In addition to the famous totem poles, painted and carved [[longhouse|house fronts]] were complemented by carved posts inside and out, as well as mortuary figures and other items. Among the [[Inuit]] of the far north, traditional carving styles in ivory and soapstone are still continued.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 553\u201356.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe arrival of European Catholic culture readily adapted local skills to the prevailing [[Baroque]] style, producing enormously elaborate [[retablo]]s and other mostly church sculptures in a variety of hybrid styles.&lt;ref&gt;Neumeyer, Alfred, ''The Indian Contribution to Architectural Decoration in Spanish Colonial America''. ''The Art Bulletin'', June 1948, Volume XXX, Number two.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous of such examples in Canada is the altar area of the [[Notre-Dame Basilica (Montreal)|Notre Dame Basilica]] in Montreal, Quebec, which was carved by peasant ''[[habitant]]'' labourers. Later, artists trained in the Western academic tradition followed European styles until in the late 19th century they began to draw again on indigenous influences, notably in the Mexican baroque grotesque style known as [[Churrigueresque]]. Aboriginal peoples also adapted church sculpture in variations on [[Carpenter Gothic]]; one famous example is the ''Church of the Holy Cross'' in [[Skookumchuck Hot Springs, British Columbia]].\n\nThe history of [[Sculpture of the United States|sculpture in the United States]] after Europeans' arrival reflects the country's 18th-century foundation in [[Roman empire|Roman]] republican civic values and [[Protestantism|Protestant Christianity]]. Compared to areas colonized by the Spanish, sculpture got off to an extremely slow start in the British colonies, with next to no place in churches, and was only given impetus by the need to assert nationality after independence. American sculpture of the mid- to late-19th century was often classical, often romantic, but showed a bent for a dramatic, narrative, almost journalistic realism. Public buildings during the last quarter of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century often provided an architectural setting for sculpture, especially in relief. By the 1930s the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] of architecture and design and [[art deco]] characterized by the work of [[Paul Manship]] and [[Lee Lawrie]] and others became popular. By the 1950s, traditional sculpture education would almost be completely replaced by a [[Bauhaus]]-influenced concern for [[Abstract art|abstract]] design. [[Minimalist]] sculpture replaced the figure in public settings and architects almost completely stopped using sculpture in or on their designs. Modern sculptors (21st century) use both classical and abstract inspired designs. Beginning in the 1980s, there was a swing back toward figurative public sculpture; by 2000, many of the new public pieces in the United States were figurative in design.\n\n&lt;gallery widths=&quot;200px&quot; heights=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;\nFile:Mountrushmore.jpg|[[Gutzon Borglum]] and his son, [[Lincoln Borglum]], ''[[Mount Rushmore]]'', 1927\u20131941.

Several different directions in the classical tradition were taken as the century turned, but the study of the live model and the post-Renaissance tradition was still fundamental to them.\n[[Auguste Rodin]] was the most renowned European sculptor of the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Elsen, Albert E. (2003). ''Rodin's Art: The Rodin Collection of the Iris &amp; Gerald B. Cantor Center for the Visual Arts''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513381-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psmuseum.org/exhibitions/upcoming_exhibition_new.php ''Rodin to Now: Modern Sculpture''], Palm Springs Desert Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; He is often considered a sculptural [[Impressionist]], as are his students including [[Camille Claudel]], and [[Hugo Rheinhold]], attempting to model of a fleeting moment of ordinary life.\nModern classicism showed a lesser interest in naturalism and a greater interest in formal stylization. Greater attention was paid to the rhythms of volumes and spaces\u2014as well as greater attention to the contrasting qualities of surface (open, closed, planar, broken etc.) while less attention was paid to story-telling and convincing details of anatomy or costume. Greater attention was given to psychological effect than to physical realism, and influences from earlier styles worldwide were used.\n\nEarly masters of modern classicism included: [[Aristide Maillol]], [[Alexander Matveyev]], [[Joseph Bernard]], [[Antoine Bourdelle]], [[Georg Kolbe]], [[Libero Andreotti]], [[Gustav Vigeland]], [[Jan Stursa]], [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]]. As the century progressed, modern classicism was adopted as the national style of the two great European totalitarian empires: [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]], who co-opted the work of earlier artists such as Kolbe and [[Wilhelm Lehmbruck]] in Germany&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Penelpoe, ''Taking Positions: Figurative Sculpture and the Third Reich'', Henry Moore Institute, London, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and Matveyev in Russia. Over the 70 years of the USSR, new generations of sculptors were trained and chosen within their system, and a distinct style, [[socialist realism]], developed, that returned to the 19th century's emphasis on melodrama and naturalism.\n\nClassical training was rooted out of art education in Western Europe (and the Americas) by 1970 and the classical variants of the 20th century were marginalized in the history of modernism. But classicism continued as the foundation of art education in the Soviet academies until 1990, providing a foundation for expressive figurative art throughout eastern Europe and parts of the Middle East. By the year 2000, the European classical tradition retains a wide appeal to the public but awaits an educational tradition to revive its contemporary development.\n\nSome of the modern classical became either more decorative/art deco ([[Paul Manship]], [[Jose de Creeft]], [[Carl Milles]]) or more abstractly stylized or more expressive (and Gothic) ([[Anton Hanak]], [[Wilhelm Lehmbruck]], [[Ernst Barlach]], [[Arturo Martini]])\u2014or turned more to the Renaissance ([[Giacomo Manz\u00f9]], [[Venanzo Crocetti]]) or stayed the same ([[Charles Despiau]], [[Marcel Gimond]]).\n\n==Modernism==\n[[File:Gaston lachaise floating figure.jpg|left|thumb|[[Gaston Lachaise]], ''Floating Figure'' 1927, bronze, no. 5 from an edition of 7, [[National Gallery of Australia]]]]\n{{main|Modern sculpture}}\n[[Modernist]] sculpture movements include [[Cubist sculpture|Cubism]], [[Geometric abstraction]], [[De Stijl]], [[Suprematism]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]] [[Abstract expressionism]], [[Pop-Art]], [[Minimalism]], [[Land art]], and [[Installation art]] among others.\n\n[[File:HenryMoore RecliningFigure 1951.jpg|left|thumb|[[Henry Moore]], ''[[Large Reclining Figure]]'', 1984 (based on a smaller model of 1938), [[Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge]]]]\n[[File:SMITH CUBI VI.JPG|thumb|right|[[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], ''CUBI VI,'' (1963), [[Israel Museum]], [[Jerusalem]].]]\nIn the early days of the 20th century, [[Pablo Picasso]] revolutionized the art of sculpture when he began creating his ''constructions'' fashioned by combining disparate objects and materials into one constructed piece of sculpture; the sculptural equivalent of the [[collage]] in two-dimensional art. The advent of [[Surrealism]] led to things occasionally being described as &quot;sculpture&quot; that would not have been so previously, such as &quot;involuntary sculpture&quot; in several senses, including [[coulage]]. In later years Picasso became a prolific [[pottery|potter]], leading, with interest in historic pottery from around the world, to a revival of [[ceramic art]], with figures such as [[George E. Ohr]] and subsequently [[Peter Voulkos]], [[Kenneth Price]], and [[Robert Arneson]]. [[Marcel Duchamp]] originated the use of the &quot;[[found object]]&quot; (French: objet trouv\u00e9) or ''readymade'' with pieces such as ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' (1917).\n\nSimilarly, the work of [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]] at the beginning of the century paved the way for later abstract sculpture. In revolt against the naturalism of Rodin and his late-19th-century contemporaries, Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i distilled subjects down to their essences as illustrated by the elegantly refined forms of his ''[[Bird in Space]]'' series (1924).&lt;ref&gt;Visual arts in the 20th century, Author Edward Lucie-Smith, Edition illustrated, Publisher Harry N. Abrams, 1997, Original from the University of Michigan, {{ISBN|978-0-8109-3934-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nBr\u00e2ncu\u0219i's impact, with his vocabulary of reduction and abstraction, is seen throughout the 1930s and 1940s, and exemplified by artists such as [[Gaston Lachaise]], [[Sir Jacob Epstein]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], [[Julio Gonz\u00e1lez (sculptor)|Julio Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Pablo Serrano]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]]&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford dictionary of American art and artists, Author Ann Lee Morgan, Publisher Oxford University Press, 2007, Original from the University of Michigan, {{ISBN|0-19-512878-8|978-0-19-512878-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 1940s abstract sculpture was impacted and expanded by [[Alexander Calder]], [[Len Lye]], [[Jean Tinguely]], and [[Frederick Kiesler]] who were pioneers of [[Kinetic art]].\n\nModernist sculptors largely missed out on the huge boom in public art resulting from the demand for [[war memorial]]s for the two World Wars, but from the 1950s the public and commissioning bodies became more comfortable with Modernist sculpture and large public commissions both abstract and figurative became common. Picasso was commissioned to make a [[maquette]] for a huge {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}}-high public sculpture, the so-called ''[[Chicago Picasso]]'' (1967). His design was ambiguous and somewhat controversial, and what the figure represents is not clear; it could be a bird, a horse, a woman or a totally abstract shape.\n\nDuring the late 1950s and the 1960s abstract sculptors began experimenting with a wide array of new materials and different approaches to creating their work. Surrealist imagery, anthropomorphic abstraction, new materials and combinations of new energy sources and varied surfaces and objects became characteristic of much new modernist sculpture. Collaborative projects with landscape designers, architects, and landscape architects expanded the outdoor site and contextual integration. Artists such as [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Jean Tinguely]], [[Richard Lippold]], [[George Rickey]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], and [[Louise Nevelson]] came to characterize the look of modern sculpture.\n\nBy the 1960s [[Abstract expressionism]], [[Geometric abstraction]] and [[Minimalism]], which reduces sculpture to its most essential and fundamental features, predominated.

[[Light sculpture]], [[Lock On (street art)|street art sculpture]] and [[site-specific art]] also often make use of the environment. [[Ice sculpture]] is a form of ephemeral sculpture that uses ice as the raw material. It is popular in China, Japan, Canada, Sweden, and Russia. Ice sculptures feature decoratively in some cuisines, especially in Asia. [[Kinetic art|Kinetic sculptures]] are sculptures that are designed to move, which include [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobiles]]. [[Snow sculpture]]s are usually carved out of a single block of snow about {{convert|6|to|15|ft|m}} on each side and weighing about 20\u201330 tons. The snow is densely packed into a form after having been produced by artificial means or collected from the ground after a snowfall. [[Sound sculpture]]s take the form of indoor sound installations, outdoor installations such as aeolian harps, automatons, or be more or less near conventional musical instruments. Sound sculpture is often site-specific. [[Art toys]] have become another format for contemporary artists since the late 1990s, such as those produced by [[Takashi Murakami]] and [[Kid Robot]], designed by [[Michael Lau]], or hand-made by [[Michael Leavitt (artist)]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Art Army by Michael Leavitt&quot;, '' hypediss.com''[http://www.hypediss.com/art_army_by_michael_leavitt], December 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Conservation==\n[[File:Pollution - Damaged by acid rain.jpg|thumb|Visible damage due to [[acid rain]] on a sculpture]]\nSculptures are sensitive to environmental conditions such as [[temperature]], [[humidity]] and exposure to light and [[ultraviolet light]]. [[Acid rain]] can also cause damage to certain building materials and historical monuments. This results when [[sulfuric acid]] in the rain chemically reacts with the calcium compounds in the stones (limestone, sandstone, marble and granite) to create [[gypsum]], which then flakes off.\n\nAt any time many contemporary sculptures have usually been on display in public places; [[theft]] was not a problem as pieces were instantly recognisable. In the early 21st century the value of metal rose to such an extent that theft of massive bronze sculpture for the value of the metal became a problem; sculpture worth millions being stolen and melted down for the relatively low value of the metal, a tiny fraction of the value of the artwork.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-16266378 BBC: Barbara Hepworth sculpture stolen from Dulwich Park, 20 December 2011].

Technology can be the [[knowledge]] of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in [[machines]] to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. [[System]]s (e.g. machines) applying technology by taking an [[Input/output|input]], changing it according to the system's use, and then producing an [[Input/output|outcome]] are referred to as '''technology systems''' or '''technological systems'''.\n\nThe simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic [[tool]]s. The [[prehistory|prehistoric]] discovery of [[Control of fire by early humans|how to control fire]] and the later [[Neolithic Revolution]] increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the [[wheel]] helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the [[printing press]], the [[telephone]], and the [[Internet]], have lessened physical barriers to [[communication]] and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.\n\nTechnology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced [[economy|economies]] (including today's [[economic globalization|global economy]]) and has allowed the rise of a [[Conspicuous leisure|leisure class]]. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as [[pollution]] and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's [[natural environment|environment]]. Innovations have always influenced the [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] of a society and raised new questions in the [[ethics of technology]]. Examples include the rise of the notion of [[efficiency]] in terms of human [[productivity]], and the challenges of [[bioethics]].\n\nPhilosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the [[human condition]] or worsens it. [[Neo-Luddism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], and similar [[reactionary]] movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as [[transhumanism]] and [[techno-progressivism]] view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the [[human condition]].\n\n== Definition and usage ==\n[[File:Handtiegelpresse von 1811.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The spread of paper and printing to the West, as in this [[printing press]], helped [[scientist]]s and [[politician]]s communicate their ideas easily, leading to the [[Age of Enlightenment]]; an example of technology as cultural force.]]\nThe use of the term &quot;technology&quot; has changed significantly over the last 200 years.

The development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge, including scientific, engineering, [[mathematics|mathematical]], [[language|linguistic]], and [[history|historical]] knowledge, to achieve some practical result.\n\nTechnology is often a consequence of science and engineering, although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields. For example, science might study the flow of [[electron]]s in [[electrical conductor]]s by using already-existing tools and knowledge. This new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as [[semiconductor]]s, [[computer]]s, and other forms of advanced technology. In this sense, scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists; the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intute.ac.uk/sciences/ |title=Intute: Science, Engineering and Technology |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=[[Intute]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217141847/http://www.intute.ac.uk/sciences/ |archive-date=17 February 2007 |url-status=dead |accessdate=17 February 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe exact relations between science and technology, in particular, have been debated by scientists, historians, and policymakers in the late 20th century, in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science. In the immediate wake of [[World War II]], for example, it was widely considered in the United States that technology was simply &quot;applied science&quot; and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time. An articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in [[Vannevar Bush]]'s treatise on postwar science policy, ''Science \u2013 The Endless Frontier'': &quot;New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature&amp;nbsp;...

[[Medieval technology]] saw the use of [[simple machine]]s (such as the [[lever]], the [[screw]], and the [[pulley]]) being combined to form more complicated tools, such as the [[wheelbarrow]], [[windmill]]s and [[clock]]s, and a system of [[University|universities]] developed and spread scientific ideas and practices. The [[Renaissance technology|Renaissance]] era produced many innovations, including the [[printing press]] (which facilitated the communication of knowledge), and technology became increasingly associated with [[science]], beginning a cycle of mutual advancement. Advances in technology in this era allowed a more reliable supply of food, followed by the wider availability of [[consumer goods]].\n\n[[File:Late model Ford Model T.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|The [[automobile]] revolutionized personal transportation.]]\nStarting in the United Kingdom in the 18th century, the [[Industrial Revolution]] was a period of great technological discovery, particularly in the areas of [[British Agricultural Revolution|agriculture]], [[manufacturing]], [[mining]], [[metallurgy]], and [[transport]], driven by the discovery of [[steam power]] and the widespread application of the [[factory system]]. Technology took another step in a [[second industrial revolution]] ({{circa | 1870}} to {{circa | 1914}}) with the harnessing of [[electricity]] to allow such innovations as the [[electric motor]], [[light bulb]], and countless others. Scientific advances and the discovery of new concepts later allowed for [[aviation|powered flight]] and developments in [[medicine]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], and [[engineering]]. The rise in technology has led to [[skyscraper]]s and broad [[urban area]]s whose inhabitants rely on [[motor]]s to transport them and their food supplies. Communication improved with the invention of the [[telegraph]], [[telephone]], [[radio]] and [[television]]. The late-19th and early-20th centuries saw a revolution in transportation with the invention of the [[airplane]] and [[automobile]].\n\n[[File:USAF F-16A F-15C F-15E Desert Storm edit2.jpg|thumb|[[F-15]] and [[F-16]] flying over [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] during the [[Gulf War]] in 1991.]]\nThe 20th century brought a host of innovations.

Dick]] and [[William Gibson]] and films such as ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technology's impact on human society and identity.\n\nThe late cultural critic [[Neil Postman]] distinguished tool-using societies from technological societies and from what he called &quot;technopolies,&quot; societies that are dominated by the ideology of technological and scientific progress to the exclusion or harm of other cultural practices, values, and world-views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology|last=Postman|first=Neil|publisher=Vintage|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Darin Barney]] has written about technology's impact on practices of [[citizenship]] and democratic culture, suggesting that technology can be construed as (1) an object of political debate, (2) a means or medium of discussion, and (3) a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship. As a setting for democratic culture, Barney suggests that technology tends to make [[ethics|ethical]] questions, including the question of what a good life consists in, nearly impossible because they already give an answer to the question: a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=One Nation Under Google|last=Barney|first=Darin|publisher=House of Anansi Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Nikolas Kompridis]] has also [http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia08/parrhesia08_kompridis.pdf written] about the dangers of new technology, such as [[genetic engineering]], [[nanotechnology]], [[synthetic biology]], and [[robotics]]. He warns that these technologies introduce unprecedented new challenges to human beings, including the possibility of the permanent alteration of our biological nature. These concerns are shared by other philosophers, scientists and public intellectuals who have written about similar issues (e.g. [[Francis Fukuyama]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]], [[Bill Joy|William Joy]], and [[Michael Sandel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Technology's Challenge to Democracy|journal=Parrhesia|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAnother prominent critic of technology is [[Hubert Dreyfus]], who has published books such as ''On the Internet'' and ''What Computers Still Can't Do''.\n\nA more infamous anti-technological treatise is ''[[s:Industrial Society and Its Future|Industrial Society and Its Future]]'', written by the Unabomber [[Ted Kaczynski]] and printed in several major newspapers (and later books) as part of an effort to end his bombing campaign of the techno-industrial infrastructure. There are also subcultures that disapprove of some or most technology, such as self-identified [[off-gridder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vannini, Phillip, and Jonathan Taggart. &quot;Voluntary simplicity, involuntary complexities, and the pull of remove: The radical ruralities of off-grid lifestyles.&quot; Environment and Planning A 45.2 (2013): 295-311.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Appropriate technology===\n{{See also|Technocriticism|Technorealism}}\nThe notion of [[appropriate technology]] was developed in the 20th century by thinkers such as [[E.F. Schumacher]] and [[Jacques Ellul]] to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new technologies or those that required access to some centralized [[infrastructure]] or parts or skills imported from elsewhere. The [[ecovillage]] movement emerged in part due to this concern.\n\n===Optimism and skepticism in the 21st century===\n''This section mainly focuses on American concerns even if it can reasonably be generalized to other Western countries. ''\n\n{{Quotation|The inadequate quantity and quality of American jobs is one of the most fundamental economic challenges we face. [...] What's the linkage between technology and this fundamental problem?|Bernstein, Jared|&quot;It\u2019s Not a Skills Gap That\u2019s Holding Wages Down: It\u2019s the Weak\nEconomy, Among Other Things,&quot; in ''[[The American Prospect]]''|October 2014}}\n\nIn his article, [[Jared Bernstein]], a Senior Fellow at the [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbpp.org/jared-bernstein|title=Jared Bernstein|last=|first=|date=2013-09-13|website=|publisher=[[Center for Budget and Policy Priorities]]|access-date=11 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112022614/http://www.cbpp.org/jared-bernstein|archive-date=12 November 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; questions the widespread idea that [[automation]], and more broadly, technological advances, have mainly contributed to this growing [[labor market]] problem.\nHis thesis appears to be a third way between optimism and skepticism. Essentially, he stands for a neutral approach of the linkage between technology and American issues concerning [[unemployment]] and declining wages.\n\nHe uses two main arguments to defend his point.\nFirst, because of recent technological advances, an increasing number of workers are losing their jobs. Yet, scientific evidence fails to clearly demonstrate that technology has displaced so many workers that it has created more problems than it has solved. Indeed, [[automation]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;threatens repetitive jobs but higher-end jobs are still necessary because they complement technology and manual jobs that &quot;requires flexibility judgment and common sense&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=It's Not a Skills Gap That's Holding Wages Down: It's the Weak Economy, Among Other Things|journal=The American Prospect|volume=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; remain hard to replace with [[machine]]s. Second, studies have not shown clear links between recent technology advances and the wage trends of the last decades.\n\nTherefore, according to Bernstein, instead of focusing on technology and its hypothetical influences on current American increasing unemployment and declining wages, one needs to worry more about &quot;bad policy that fails to offset the imbalances in demand, trade, income, and opportunity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;\n\nFor people who use both the Internet and mobile devices in excessive quantities it is likely for them to experience [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and over exhaustion as a result of disruptions in their sleeping patterns.

Hughes]] stated that because technology has been considered as a key way to solve problems, we need to be aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more efficiently.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human-Built World: How to Think About Technology and Culture|last=Hughes|first=Thomas P.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-226-35933-5|location=Chicago|pages=1\u201311|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is the difference between a [[wheel]] or a [[compass]] and cooking machines such as an [[oven]] or a [[gas stove]]? Can we consider all of them, only a part of them, or none of them as technologies?\n\nTechnology is often considered too narrowly; according to Hughes, &quot;Technology is a creative process involving human ingenuity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes, Thomas P. 2004&quot;&gt;Hughes, Thomas P. (2004) &quot;Introduction: Complex Technology&quot; (1\u201311) in &quot;Human-Built World: How to Think About Technology and Culture&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This definition's emphasis on creativity avoids unbounded definitions that may mistakenly include cooking &quot;technologies,&quot; but it also highlights the prominent role of humans and therefore their responsibilities for the use of complex technological systems.\n\nYet, because technology is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies, Hughes argues that [[engineer]]s, [[scientist]]s, and [[Management|managers]] have often believed that they can use technology to shape the world as they want. They have often supposed that technology is easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly questioned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; For instance, [[Evgeny Morozov]] particularly challenges two concepts: &quot;Internet-centrism&quot; and &quot;solutionism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=To Save Everything, Click Here: The Folly of Technological Solutionism|last=Morozov|first=Evgeny|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2013|isbn=978-1-61039-139-9|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/tosaveeverything0000moro}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet-centrism refers to the idea that our society is convinced that the Internet is one of the most stable and coherent forces. Solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet. In fact, technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations. According to [[Alexis Madrigal]]'s review of Morozov's theory, to ignore it will lead to &quot;unexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to address.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/toward-a-complex-realistic-and-moral-tech-criticism/273996/|title=Toward a Complex, Realistic, and Moral Tech Criticism|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis C.|date=13 March 2013|work=The Atlantic|access-date=11 November 2016|via=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525080146/https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/toward-a-complex-realistic-and-moral-tech-criticism/273996/|archive-date=25 May 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin R.

However, major wars over shorter periods have resulted in much higher casualty rates, with 100-200 casualties per 100,000 over a few years. While conventional wisdom holds that casualties have increased in recent times due to technological improvements in warfare, this is not generally true. For instance, the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648) had about the same number of casualties per capita as [[World War I]], although it was higher during [[World War II]] (WWII). That said, overall the number of casualties from war has not significantly increased in recent times.

By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare.\n\nThe Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of [[Melanie Klein]], thought war was the paranoid or projective \u201celaboration\u201d of mourning.&lt;ref&gt;(Fornari 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Fornari thought war and violence develop out of our \u201clove need\u201d: our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation.\n\nDespite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, few wars have originated from a desire for war among the general populace.&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, T.C.W. &quot;The Origin of Great Wars.&quot; ''The Origins of the French Revolutionary Wars.'' p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Maurice N. ''War and the Human Race.'' 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues the general populace is more neutral towards war and wars occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power. War is caused by leaders who seek war such as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war.\n\n{{Quotation|Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. ... the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.

Under another rationalist game theory without bargaining, the [[peace war game]], optimal strategies can still be found that depend upon number of iterations played. In &quot;Rationalist Explanations for War&quot;, [[James Fearon]] examined three rationalist explanations for why some countries engage in war:\n* Issue indivisibilities\n* Incentives to misrepresent or [[information asymmetry]]\n* Commitment problems&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;\n\n&quot;Issue indivisibility&quot; occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining, because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, but only owned entirely by one side or the other.\n\n[[File:U.S. Marines in Operation Allen Brook (Vietnam War) 001.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. Marines direct a concentration of fire at the enemy, Vietnam, 8 May 1968]]\n&quot;[[Information asymmetry]] with incentives to misrepresent&quot; occurs when two countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of state's victory or loss.

Societies are characterized by patterns of relationships ([[social relation]]s) between individuals who share a distinctive [[culture]] and [[institutions]]; a given society may be described as the sum total of such relationships among its constituent of members. In the [[social science]]s, a larger society often exhibits [[social stratification|stratification]] or [[dominance hierarchy|dominance]] patterns in subgroups.\n\nSocieties construct patterns of behavior by deeming certain actions or speech as acceptable or unacceptable. These patterns of behavior within a given society are known as [[societal norms]]. Societies, and their norms, undergo gradual and perpetual changes.\n\nInsofar as it is [[collaborative]], a society can enable its members to benefit in ways that would otherwise be difficult on an individual basis; both individual and social (common) benefits can thus be distinguished, or in many cases found to overlap. A society can also consist of like-minded people governed by their own norms and values within a dominant, larger society. This is sometimes referred to as a [[subculture]], a term used extensively within [[criminology]].\n\nMore broadly, and especially within [[Structuralism|structuralist thought]], a society may be illustrated as an [[economic]], social, [[Industry|industrial]] or [[culture|cultural]] [[infrastructure]], made up of, yet distinct from, a varied collection of individuals. In this regard society can mean the objective relationships people have with the material world and with other people, rather than &quot;other people&quot; beyond the individual and their familiar social environment.\n\n==Etymology and usage==\n{{wide image|Gu Hongzhong's Night Revels 1.jpg|700px|A half-section of the 12th-century [[Song dynasty#Southern Song, 1127\u20131279|Southern Song dynasty]] version of ''[[The Night Revels of Han Xizai]]'', original by [[Gu Hongzhong]] in the 10th century. The painting portrays servants, musicians, monks, children, guests, and hosts all in a single social environment. It serves as an in-depth look into the Chinese social structure of the time.}}\n\nThe term &quot;society&quot; came from the [[Latin]] word ''[[Wikt:societas|societas]]'', which in turn was derived from the noun ''socius'' (&quot;[[comrade]], friend, ally&quot;; adjectival form ''socialis'') used to describe a bond or interaction between parties that are friendly, or at least civil. Without an article, the term can refer to the entirety of humanity (also: &quot;society in general&quot;, &quot;society at large&quot;, etc.), although those who are unfriendly or uncivil to the remainder of society in this sense may be deemed to be &quot;antisocial&quot;. However, the [[Scotland|Scottish]] economist, [[Adam Smith]] taught instead that a society &quot;may subsist among different men, as among different merchants, from a sense of its [[utility]] without any mutual love or affection, if only they refrain from doing injury to each other.&quot;&lt;ref name=Briggs9/&gt;\n\nUsed in the sense of an [[Voluntary association|association]], a society is a body of individuals outlined by the bounds of functional [[interdependence]], possibly comprising characteristics such as [[national identity|national]] or [[cultural identity]], [[social solidarity]], [[language]], or [[hierarchy|hierarchical structure]].\n\n==Conceptions==\nSociety, in general, addresses the fact that an individual has rather limited means as an [[autonomy|autonomous unit]]. The [[great apes]] have always been more (''[[Bonobo]]'', ''[[Human being|Homo]]'', ''[[Pan (genus)|Pan]]'') or less (''[[Gorilla]]'', ''[[Orangutan|Pongo]]'') [[social animal]]s, so [[Robinson Crusoe]]-like situations are either fictions or unusual [[corner case]]s to the ubiquity of social context for humans, who fall between [[presocial]] and [[eusociality|eusocial]] in the spectrum of [[primate#Social systems|animal ethology]].\n\n[[Cultural relativism]] as a widespread approach or ethic has largely replaced notions of &quot;primitive&quot;, better/worse, or &quot;progress&quot; in relation to cultures (including their material culture/technology and social organization).\n\nAccording to anthropologist [[Maurice Godelier]], one critical novelty in society, in contrast to humanity's closest biological relatives (chimpanzees and bonobos), is the parental role assumed by the males, which supposedly would be absent in our nearest relatives for whom paternity is not generally determinable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Godelier]], M\u00e9tamorphoses de la parent\u00e9, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2592|journal=New Left Review|author=Jack Goody|title=The Labyrinth of Kinship|accessdate=24 July 2007|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004209/http://newleftreview.org/?view=2592|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== In political science ===\nSocieties may also be structured politically. In order of increasing size and complexity, there are bands, tribes, chiefdoms, and state societies. These structures may have varying degrees of political power, depending on the cultural, geographical, and historical environments that these societies must contend with. Thus, a more isolated society with the same level of technology and culture as other societies is more likely to survive than one in close proximity to others that may encroach on their resources. A society that is unable to offer an effective response to other societies it competes with will usually be subsumed into the culture of the competing society.\n\n=== In sociology ===\n[[File:Ants' Social Ethology.jpg|thumb|right|The social group enables its members to benefit in ways that would not otherwise be possible on an individual basis. Both individual and social (common) goals can thus be distinguished and considered. Ant (formicidae) [[Ethology|social ethology]].]]\n[[Sociology|Sociologist]] [[Peter L. Berger]] defines society as &quot;...a human product, and nothing but a human product, that yet continuously acts upon its producers.&quot;  According to him, society was created by humans, but this creation turns back and creates or molds humans every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Scared Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion|last = Berger|first = Peter L.|publisher = Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc.|year = 1967|isbn = |location = Garden City, NYC|page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[File:Canis lupus pack surrounding Bison.jpg|thumb|right|''Canis lupus'' [[Ethology|social ethology]]]]\n\nSociologist [[Gerhard Lenski]] differentiates societies based on their level of technology, communication, and economy: (1) hunters and gatherers, (2) simple agricultural, (3) advanced agricultural, (4) industrial, and (5) special (e.g. fishing societies or maritime societies).&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, G. 1974. ''Human Societies: An Introduction to Macrosociology.''{{pn|date=January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to the system earlier developed by anthropologists Morton H. Fried, a conflict theorist, and [[Elman Service]], an integration theorist, who have produced a system of classification for societies in all human cultures based on the evolution of [[social inequality]] and the role of the [[State (polity)|state]]. This system of classification contains four categories:\n* [[Hunter-gatherer]] bands (categorization of duties and responsibilities). Then came the agricultural society.\n* [[Tribe|Tribal]] societies in which there are some limited instances of [[social rank]] and prestige.\n* [[Social stratification|Stratified]] structures led by [[tribal chief|chieftains]].\n* [[Civilization]]s, with complex [[social hierarchies]] and organized, [[government|institutional governments]].\n\nIn addition to this there are:\n* [[All humanity|Humanity]], humankind, upon which rest all the elements of society, including society's beliefs.\n* [[Sociology of the Internet|Virtual society]], a society based on online identity, which is evolving in the information age.\n\nOver time, some [[cultures]] have progressed toward more complex forms of [[organization]] and control. This [[cultural evolution]] has a profound effect on patterns of community. Hunter-gatherer tribes settled around seasonal food stocks to become [[Neolithic Revolution|agrarian villages]]. Villages grew to become towns and cities. Cities turned into [[city-state]]s and [[nation-state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Effland, R. 1998. [http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/dept/d10/asb/anthro2003/glues/model_complex.html The Cultural Evolution of Civilizations] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515120848/http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/dept/d10/asb/anthro2003/glues/model_complex.html |date=15 May 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nMany societies distribute largess at the behest of some individual or some larger group of people. This type of generosity can be seen in all known cultures; typically, prestige accrues to the generous individual or group. Conversely, members of a society may also shun or [[scapegoat]] any members of the society who violate its [[Norm (sociology)|norms]]. Mechanisms such as [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|gift-giving]], [[joking relationship]]s and [[scapegoating]], which may be seen in various types of human groupings, tend to be [[institution]]alized within a society. Social evolution as a phenomenon carries with it certain elements that could be detrimental to the population it serves.\n\nSome societies bestow status on an individual or group of people when that individual or group performs an admired or desired action. This type of [[Recognition (sociology)|recognition]] is bestowed in the form of a name, title, manner of dress, or monetary reward. In many societies, adult male or female status is subject to a ritual or process of this type. Altruistic action in the interests of the larger group is seen in virtually all societies. The phenomena of community action, shunning, scapegoating, generosity, shared risk, and reward are common to many forms of society.\n\n==Types==\nSocieties are [[social groups]] that differ according to [[List of subsistence techniques|subsistence strategies]], the ways that humans use technology to provide needs for themselves. Although humans have established many types of societies throughout history, anthropologists tend to classify different societies according to the degree to which different groups within a society have unequal access to advantages such as resources, prestige, or power. Virtually all societies have developed some degree of inequality among their people through the process of social stratification, the division of members of a society into levels with unequal wealth, prestige, or power. Sociologists place societies in three broad categories: [[pre-industrial]], [[industrial society|industrial]], and [[postindustrial]].\n\n===Pre-industrial===\n{{Main article|Pre-industrial society}}\nIn a pre-industrial society, food production, which is carried out through the use of human and animal [[Manual labour|labor]], is the main economic activity. These societies can be subdivided according to their level of technology and their method of producing food. These subdivisions are hunting and gathering, pastoral, horticultural, agricultural, and feudal.\n\n==== Hunting and gathering ====\n{{Main article|Hunter-gatherer society}}\n[[File:BushmenSan.jpg|thumb|[[San people]] in Botswana start a fire by hand.]]\nThe main form of food production in such societies is the daily collection of wild plants and the hunting of wild animals. Hunter-gatherers move around constantly in search of food. As a result, they do not build permanent [[villages]] or create a wide variety of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], and usually only form small groups such as [[Band society|bands]] and [[tribe]]s. However, some hunting and gathering societies in areas with abundant resources (such as people of [[Tlingit people|tlingit]]) lived in larger groups and formed complex hierarchical social structures such as chiefdom. The need for mobility also limits the size of these societies. They generally consist of fewer than 60 people and rarely exceed 100. Statuses within the tribe are relatively equal, and decisions are reached through general agreement. The ties that bind the tribe are more complex than those of the bands. [[Leadership]] is personal\u2014charismatic\u2014and used for special purposes only in tribal society. There are no political offices containing real power, and a [[Tribal chief|chief]] is merely a person of influence, a sort of adviser; therefore, tribal consolidations for collective action are not governmental. The family forms the main [[social unit]], with most members being related by birth or marriage. This type of organization requires the family to carry out most social functions, including [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] and [[education]].\n\n==== Pastoral ====\n{{Main article|Pastoral society}}\n[[Pastoralism]] is a slightly more efficient form of subsistence. Rather than searching for food on a daily basis, members of a pastoral society rely on domesticated herd animals to meet their food needs. Pastoralists live a nomadic life, moving their herds from one pasture to another. Because their food supply is far more reliable, pastoral societies can support larger populations. Since there are food surpluses, fewer people are needed to produce food. As a result, the division of labor (the specialization by individuals or groups in the performance of specific economic activities) becomes more complex. For example, some people become craftworkers, producing [[tools]], [[weapons]], and [[jewelry]], among other items of value. The production of goods encourages trade. This trade helps to create inequality, as some families acquire more goods than others do. These families often gain power through their increased [[wealth]]. The passing on of property from one generation to another helps to centralize wealth and power. Over time emerge hereditary chieftainships, the typical form of [[government]] in pastoral societies.\n\n==== Horticultural ====\n{{Main article|Horticulturalist society}}\nFruits and vegetables grown in garden plots that have been cleared from the jungle or forest provide the main source of food in a horticultural society. These societies have a level of [[technology]] and complexity similar to pastoral societies. Some horticultural groups use the slash-and-burn method to raise crops. The wild vegetation is cut and burned, and ashes are used as fertilizers. Horticulturists use human labor and simple tools to cultivate the land for one or more seasons. When the land becomes barren, horticulturists clear a new plot and leave the old plot to revert to its natural state. They may return to the original land several years later and begin the process again. By rotating their garden plots, horticulturists can stay in one area for a fairly long period of time. This allows them to build semipermanent or permanent villages. The size of a village's population depends on the amount of land available for farming; thus villages can range from as few as 30 people to as many as 2000.\n\nAs with pastoral societies, surplus food leads to a more complex division of labor. Specialized roles in horticultural societies include craftspeople, [[shamans]] (religious leaders), and traders. This role specialization allows people to create a wide variety of artifacts. As in pastoral societies, surplus food can lead to inequalities in wealth and power within horticultural political systems, developed because of the settled nature of horticultural life.\n\n==== Agrarian ====\n{{Main article|Agrarian society}}\n[[File:Detail of Les tres riches heures - March.jpg|thumb|Ploughing with oxen in the 15th century]]\nAgrarian societies use agricultural [[technological]] advances to cultivate crops over a large area. Sociologists use the phrase [[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural revolution]] to refer to the technological changes that occurred as long as 8,500 years ago that led to cultivating crops and raising farm animals. Increases in food supplies then led to larger populations than in earlier communities. This meant a greater surplus, which resulted in towns that became centers of trade supporting various rulers, educators, craftspeople, merchants, and religious leaders who did not have to worry about locating nourishment.\n\nGreater degrees of social stratification appeared in agrarian societies. For example, women previously had higher social status because they shared labor more equally with men. In hunting and gathering societies, women even gathered more food than men. However, as food stores improved and women took on lesser roles in providing food for the family, they increasingly became subordinate to men. As villages and towns expanded into neighboring areas, conflicts with other communities inevitably occurred. Farmers provided warriors with food in [[Trade|exchange]] for protection against invasion by enemies. A system of rulers with high social status also appeared. This nobility organized warriors to protect the society from invasion. In this way, the nobility managed to extract goods from &quot;lesser&quot; members of society.\n\n[[File:Cleric-Knight-Workman.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Cleric, knight and peasant; an example of feudal societies]]\n\n==== Feudal ====\n{{Main article|Feudal society}}\n[[Feudalism]] was a form of society based on ownership of land. Unlike today's farmers, vassals under feudalism were bound to cultivating their lord's land. In exchange for military protection, the lords exploited the peasants into providing food, crops, crafts, homage, and other services to the landowner. The [[estates of the realm]] system of feudalism was often multigenerational; the families of peasants may have cultivated their lord's land for generations.\n\n===Industrial===\n{{main article|Industrial societies}}\nBetween the 15th and 16th centuries, a new economic system emerged that began to replace feudalism. [[Capitalism]] is marked by open competition in a free market, in which the means of production are privately owned. Europe's exploration of the Americas served as one impetus for the development of capitalism. The introduction of foreign metals, silks, and spices stimulated great commercial activity in European societies.\n\nIndustrial societies rely heavily on machines powered by fuels for the production of goods. This produced further dramatic increases in efficiency. The increased efficiency of production of the industrial revolution produced an even greater surplus than before. Now the surplus was not just agricultural goods, but also manufactured goods. This larger surplus caused all of the changes discussed earlier in the domestication revolution to become even more pronounced.\n\nOnce again, the population boomed. Increased productivity made more goods available to everyone. However, inequality became even greater than before. The breakup of agricultural-based feudal societies caused many people to leave the land and seek employment in cities. This created a great surplus of labor and gave capitalists plenty of laborers who could be hired for extremely low wages.\n\n===Post-industrial===\n{{main article|Post-industrial society}}\n{{see also|Information revolution}}\nPost-industrial societies are societies dominated by information, services, and high technology more than the production of goods. Advanced industrial societies are now seeing a shift toward an increase in service sectors over manufacturing and production. The United States is the first country to have over half of its work force employed in service industries. Service industries include government, research, education, health, sales, law, and banking.\n\n==Contemporary usage==\nThe term &quot;society&quot; is currently used to cover both a number of political and scientific connotations as well as a variety of associations.\n\n===Western===\n{{Main article|Western world}}\nThe development of the [[Western world]] has brought with it the emerging concepts of [[Western culture]], politics, and ideas, often referred to simply as &quot;Western society&quot;. Geographically, it covers at the very least the countries of Western Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. It sometimes also includes Eastern Europe, South America, and Israel.\n\nThe cultures and lifestyles of all of these stem from Western Europe. They all enjoy relatively strong economies and stable governments, allow freedom of religion, have chosen democracy as a form of governance, favor capitalism and international trade, are heavily influenced by [[Judeo-Christian values]], and have some form of political and military alliance or cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palgrave.com/Products/title.aspx?pid=355705 John P McKay, Bennett D Hill, John Buckler, Clare Haru Crowston and Merry E Wiesner-Hanks: ''Western Society: A Brief History''.

In keeping with the [[Biomedical model|biomedical]] perspective, early definitions of health focused on the theme of the body's ability to function; health was seen as a state of normal function that could be disrupted from time to time by [[disease]]. An example of such a definition of health is: &quot;a state characterized by anatomic, physiologic, and psychological integrity; ability to perform personally valued family, work, and community roles; ability to deal with [[Human body|physical]], [[biological]], [[Psychology|psychological]], and [[social stress]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stokes|first=J.|last2=Noren|first2=J.|last3=Shindell|first3=S.|date=1982-01-01|title=Definition of terms and concepts applicable to clinical preventive medicine|journal=Journal of Community Health|volume=8|issue=1|pages=33\u201341|issn=0094-5145|pmid=6764783|doi=10.1007/bf01324395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1948, in a radical departure from previous definitions, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) proposed a definition that aimed higher: linking health to [[well-being]], in terms of &quot;physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.who.int/iris/handle/10665/37089|title=The first ten years of the World Health Organization|last=World Health Organization|publisher=WHO|year=1958|isbn=|location=Geneva|publication-date=1958|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this definition was welcomed by some as being innovative, it was also criticized as being vague, excessively broad and was not construed as measurable. For a long time, it was set aside as an impractical ideal and most discussions of health returned to the practicality of the biomedical model.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phprimer.afmc.ca/Part1-TheoryThinkingAboutHealth/ConceptsOfHealthAndIllness/DefinitionsofHealth|title=Part 1 \u2013 Theory: Thinking About Health Chapter 1 Concepts of Health and Illness|website=phprimer.afmc.ca|access-date=2016-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812145405/http://phprimer.afmc.ca/Part1-TheoryThinkingAboutHealth/ConceptsOfHealthAndIllness/DefinitionsofHealth|archive-date=2016-08-12|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nJust as there was a shift from viewing disease as a state to thinking of it as a process, the same shift happened in definitions of health. Again, the WHO played a leading role when it fostered the development of the health promotion movement in the 1980s. This brought in a new conception of health, not as a state, but in dynamic terms of resiliency, in other words, as &quot;a resource for living&quot;. 1984 WHO revised the definition of health defined it as &quot;the extent to which an individual or group is able to realize aspirations and satisfy needs and to change or cope with the environment. Health is a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living; it is a positive concept, emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.who.int/iris/handle/10665/107835|title=Health promotion : a discussion document on the concept and principles : summary report of the Working Group on Concept and Principles of Health Promotion, Copenhagen, 9\u201313 July 1984|last=World Health Organization.

[[Disease]] is one of the most common. According to GlobalIssues.org, approximately 36&amp;nbsp;million people die each year from non-communicable (not contagious) disease including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic lung disease (Shah, 2014).\n\nAmong communicable diseases, both viral and bacterial, [[AIDS]]/[[HIV]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]] are the most common, causing millions of deaths every year (Shah, 2014).\n\nAnother health issue that causes death or contributes to other health problems is malnutrition, especially among children. One of the groups malnutrition affects most is young children. Approximately 7.5&amp;nbsp;million children under the age of 5 die from malnutrition, usually brought on by not having the money to find or make food (Shah, 2014).\n\nBodily injuries are also a common health issue worldwide. These injuries, including broken bones, fractures, and burns can reduce a person's quality of life or can cause fatalities including infections that resulted from the injury or the severity injury in general (Moffett, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Anup (5 January 2014). [http://www.globalissues.org/issue/587/health-issues &quot;Health Issues.&quot;] ''Global Issues''.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLifestyle choices are contributing factors to poor health in many cases. These include smoking cigarettes, and can also include a poor diet, whether it is overeating or an overly constrictive diet. Inactivity can also contribute to health issues and also a lack of sleep, excessive alcohol consumption, and neglect of oral hygiene (Moffett2013).There are also genetic disorders that are inherited by the person and can vary in how much they affect the person and when they surface (Moffett, 2013).\n\nThough the majority of these health issues are preventable, a major contributor to global ill health is the fact that approximately 1 billion people lack access to health care systems (Shah, 2014). Arguably, the most common and harmful health issue is that a great many people do not have access to quality remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/globalissues/health/ |title=United Nations Global Issues |publisher=Un.org |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608150700/http://www.un.org/en/globalissues/health/ |archivedate=2016-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intrahealth.org/page/the-top-10-global-health-issues-to-watch-in-2013 |title=The Top 10 Global Health Issues to Watch in 2013 |publisher=Intrahealth.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Mental health==\n{{main|Mental health}}\nThe [[World Health Organization]] describes mental health as &quot;a state of [[well-being]] in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (2005).

A healthy diet includes a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods that provide [[nutrients]] to your body. Such nutrients give you energy and keep your body running. Nutrients help build and strengthen bones, muscles, and tendons and also regulate body processes (i.e. [[blood pressure]]). Water is essential for growth, reproduction and good health. Macronutrients are consumed in relatively large quantities and include proteins, carbohydrates, and fats and fatty acids. Micronutrients \u2013 vitamins and minerals \u2013 are consumed in relatively smaller quantities, but are essential to body processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/elena/nutrient/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Nutrients|website=WHO|access-date=2019-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[food guide pyramid]] is a pyramid-shaped guide of healthy foods divided into sections.

However, holding a belief does not require active [[introspection]]. For example, few carefully consider whether or not the sun will rise tomorrow, simply assuming that it will. Moreover, beliefs need not be ''occurrent'' (e.g. a person actively thinking &quot;snow is white&quot;), but can instead be ''dispositional'' (e.g. a person who if asked about the color of snow would assert &quot;snow is white&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;SEP Belief&quot;/&gt; \n\nThere are various different ways that contemporary philosophers have tried to describe beliefs, including as representations of ways that the world could be ([[Jerry Fodor]]), as dispositions to act as if certain things are true ([[Roderick Chisholm]]), as interpretive schemes for making sense of someone's actions ([[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]), or as mental states that fill a particular function ([[Hilary Putnam]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;SEP Belief&quot;/&gt; Some have also attempted to offer significant revisions to our notion of belief, including [[Eliminativism|eliminativists]] about belief who argue that there is no phenomenon in the natural world which corresponds to our [[folk psychology|folk psychological]] concept of belief ([[Paul Churchland]]) and [[Formal epistemology|formal epistemologists]] who aim to replace our bivalent notion of belief (&quot;either we have a belief or we don't have a belief&quot;) with the more permissive, probabilistic notion of credence (&quot;there is an entire spectrum of degrees of belief, not a simple dichotomy between belief and non-belief&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;SEP Belief&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SEP Formal Belief&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Formal Representations of Belief |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/formal-belief/ |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=22 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nBeliefs are the subject of various important philosophical debates. Notable examples include: &quot;What is the rational way to revise one's beliefs when presented with various sorts of evidence?&quot;; &quot;Is the content of our beliefs entirely determined by our mental states, or do the relevant facts have any bearing on our beliefs (e.g. if I believe that I'm holding a glass of water, is the non-mental fact that water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O part of the content of that belief)?&quot;; &quot;How fine-grained or coarse-grained are our beliefs?&quot;; and &quot;Must it be possible for a belief to be expressible in language, or are there non-linguistic beliefs?&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEP Belief&quot;/&gt;\n\n==Psychology==\nMainstream psychology and related disciplines have traditionally treated belief as if it were the simplest form of mental representation and therefore one of the building blocks of conscious thought. Philosophers have tended to be more abstract in their analysis, and much of the work examining the viability of the belief concept stems from philosophical analysis.\n\nThe concept of belief presumes a subject (the believer) and an object of belief (the proposition). So, like other [[propositional attitude]]s, belief implies the existence of [[mental state]]s and [[intentionality]], both of which are hotly debated topics in the [[philosophy of mind]], whose foundations and relation to brain states are still controversial.\n\nBeliefs are sometimes divided into [[core beliefs]] (that are actively thought about) and [[dispositional belief]]s (that may be ascribed to someone who has not thought about the issue). For example, if asked &quot;do you believe tigers wear pink pajamas?&quot; a person might answer that they do not, despite the fact they may never have thought about this situation before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bell |first1=V. |last2=Halligan |first2=P.W. |last3=Ellis |first3=H.D. |year=2006 |chapter=A Cognitive Neuroscience of Belief |editor1-first=Peter W. |editor1-last=Halligan |editor2-first=Mansel |editor2-last=Aylward |title=The Power of Belief: Psychological Influence on Illness, Disability, and Medicine |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-853010-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThis has important implications for understanding the [[neuropsychology]] and [[neuroscience]] of belief. If the concept of belief is incoherent, then any attempt to find the underlying neural processes that support it will fail.\n\nPhilosopher [[Lynne Rudder Baker]] has outlined four main contemporary approaches to belief in her book ''Saving Belief'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lynne Rudder |last=Baker |title=Saving Belief: A Critique of Physicalism |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1989 |location= |isbn=978-0-691-07320-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Our common-sense understanding of belief is correct \u2013 Sometimes called the &quot;mental sentence theory,&quot; in this conception, beliefs exist as coherent entities, and the way we talk about them in everyday life is a valid basis for scientific endeavour. [[Jerry Fodor]] was one of the principal defenders of this point of view.\n* Our common-sense understanding of belief may not be entirely correct, but it is close enough to make some useful predictions \u2013 This view argues that we will eventually reject the idea of belief as we know it now, but that there may be a correlation between what we take to be a belief when someone says &quot;I believe that snow is white&quot; and how a future theory of psychology will explain this behaviour. Philosopher [[Stephen Stich]] has argued for this particular understanding of belief.\n* Our common-sense understanding of belief is entirely wrong and will be completely superseded by a radically different theory that will have no use for the concept of belief as we know it \u2013 Known as [[eliminativism]], this view (most notably proposed by [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]]) argues that the concept of belief is like obsolete theories of times past such as [[the four humours]] theory of medicine, or the [[phlogiston theory]] of combustion. In these cases science has not provided us with a more detailed account of these theories, but completely rejected them as valid scientific concepts to be replaced by entirely different accounts. The Churchlands argue that our common-sense concept of belief is similar in that as we discover more about neuroscience and the brain, the inevitable conclusion will be to reject the belief hypothesis in its entirety.\n* Our common-sense understanding of belief is entirely wrong; however, treating people, animals, and even computers as if they had beliefs is often a successful strategy \u2013 The major proponents of this view, [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Lynne Rudder Baker]], are both eliminativists in that they hold that beliefs are not a scientifically valid concept, but they do not go as far as rejecting the concept of belief as a predictive device. Dennett gives the example of playing a computer at chess. While few people would agree that the computer held beliefs, treating the computer as if it did (e.g. that the computer believes that taking the opposition's queen will give it a considerable advantage) is likely to be a successful and predictive strategy. In this understanding of belief, named by Dennett ''the [[intentional stance]]'', belief-based explanations of mind and behaviour are at a different level of explanation and are not reducible to those based on fundamental neuroscience, although both may be explanatory at their own level.\nStrategic approaches make a distinction between rules, norms and beliefs as follows:\n* Rules. Explicit regulative processes such as policies, laws, inspection routines, or incentives. Rules function as a coercive regulator of behavior and are dependent upon the imposing entity's ability to enforce them.\n* Norms. Regulative mechanisms accepted by the social collective. Norms are enforced by normative mechanisms within the organization and are not strictly dependent upon law or regulation.\n* Beliefs. The collective perception of fundamental truths governing behavior. The adherence to accepted and shared beliefs by members of a social system will likely persist and be difficult to change over time. Strong beliefs about determinant factors (i.e., security, survival, or honor) are likely to cause a social entity or group to accept rules and norms.&lt;ref&gt;Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Army (2012).

Simplified, ''pistis'' refers to &quot;[[Trust (social science)|trust]]&quot; and &quot;confidence,&quot; ''doxa'' refers to &quot;[[opinion]]&quot; and &quot;acceptance,&quot; and ''dogma'' refers to the [[Philosophical theory|positions]] of a philosopher or of a [[Philosophical movement|philosophical school]] such as [[Stoicism]].\n\n== Emotion and beliefs ==\n{{Expand section|date=January 2020}}\nResearch has indicated that [[emotion]] and cognition act in conjunction to produce beliefs, and more specifically emotion plays a vital role in the formation and maintenance of beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Emotions and Beliefs|last=Frijda|first=Nico H|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780511659904|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mercer|first=Jonathan|date=January 2010|title=Emotional Beliefs|journal=International Organization|volume=65|pages=1\u201331|doi=10.1017/S0020818309990221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Harl\u00e9|first1=Katia M.|last2=Shenoy|first2=Pradeep|last3=Paulus|first3=Martin P.|date=2013-09-19|title=The influence of emotions on cognitive control: feelings and beliefs\u2014where do they meet?|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume=7|pages=508|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00508|issn=1662-5161|pmc=3776943|pmid=24065901}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Formation==\n[[File:Ripples of influence.jpg|thumb|We are influenced by many factors that ripple through our minds as our beliefs form, evolve, and may eventually change]]\nPsychologists study belief formation and the relationship between beliefs and actions. Three models of belief formation and change have been proposed:\n\n===Conditional inference process===\nWhen people are asked to estimate the likelihood that a statement is true, they search their memory for information that has implications for the validity of this statement. Once this information has been identified, they estimate the likelihood that the statement would be true if the information were true, and the likelihood that the statement would be true if the information were false. If their estimates for these two [[Probability|probabilities]] differ, people average them, weighting each by the likelihood that the information is true and false. Thus, information bears directly on beliefs of another, related statement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wyer, R. S. 2005&quot;&gt;Wyer, R.S., &amp; Albarracin, D. (2005).

New York: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Linear models===\nUnlike the previous model, this one takes into consideration the possibility of multiple factors influencing belief formation. Using regression procedures, this model predicts belief formation on the basis of several different pieces of information, with weights assigned to each piece on the basis of their relative importance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wyer, R. S. 2005&quot; /&gt;\n\n===Information processing models and change===\nThese models address the fact that the responses people have to belief-relevant information is unlikely to be predicted from the objective basis of the information that they can recall at the time their beliefs are reported.

One process of belief revision is [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian updating]] and is often referenced for its mathematical basis and conceptual simplicity. However, such a process may not be representative for individuals whose beliefs are not easily characterized as probabilistic.\n\nThere are several techniques for individuals or groups to change the beliefs of others; these methods generally fall under the umbrella of [[persuasion]]. Persuasion can take on more specific forms such as [[consciousness raising]] when considered in an activist or political context.\nBelief modification may also occur as a result of the experience of outcomes. Because [[goal]]s are based, in part on beliefs, the success or failure at a particular goal may contribute to modification of beliefs that supported the original goal.\n\nWhether or not belief modification actually occurs is dependent not only on the extent of truths or evidence for the alternative belief, but also characteristics outside the specific truths or evidence. This includes, but is not limited to: the source characteristics of the message, such as [[Source credibility|credibility]]; [[Peer pressure|social pressures]]; the anticipated consequences of a modification; or the ability of the individual or group to act on the modification. Therefore, individuals seeking to achieve belief modification in themselves or others need to consider all possible forms of resistance to belief revision.\n\n==Prediction==\nDifferent psychological models have tried to predict people's beliefs and some of them try to estimate the exact probabilities of beliefs. For example, [[Robert S. Wyer|Robert Wyer]] developed a model of subjective probabilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wyer, R. S. 1970&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wyer |first=R.S. |year=1970 |title=Quantitative prediction of belief and opinion change: A further test of a subjective probability model |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=559\u2013570 |doi=10.1037/h0030064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WyerGoldberg&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wyer |first1=R.S. |last2=Goldberg |first2=L. |year=1970 |title=A probabilistic analysis of the relationships among beliefs and attitudes |journal=Psychological Review |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=100\u2013120 |doi=10.1037/h0028769 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When people rate the likelihood of a certain statement (e.g., &quot;It will rain tomorrow&quot;), this rating can be seen as a subjective probability value. The subjective probability model posits that these subjective probabilities follow the same rules as objective probabilities. For example, the [[law of total probability]] might be applied to predict a subjective probability value. Wyer found that this model produces relatively accurate predictions for probabilities of single events and for changes in these probabilities, but that the probabilities of several beliefs linked by &quot;and&quot; or &quot;or&quot; do not follow the model as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wyer, R.

The Gettier problem gives us reason to think that not all justified true beliefs constitute knowledge.]]\n[[Epistemology]] is concerned with delineating the boundary between justified belief and [[opinion]],&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionaries \u2013 [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/epistemology definition] published by [[OUP]] [Retrieved 2015-08-09]&lt;/ref&gt; and involved generally with a theoretical [[philosophical]] study of [[knowledge]]. The primary problem in epistemology is to understand exactly what is needed in order for us to have knowledge. In a notion derived from [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', where the epistemology of Socrates (Platon) most clearly departs from that of the [[sophist]]s, who at the time of Plato seem to have defined knowledge as what is here expressed as &quot;[[justified true belief]]&quot;. The tendency to translate from belief (here: doxa \u2013 common opinion) to knowledge (here: episteme), which Plato (e.g. [[Socrates]] of the dialogue) utterly dismisses, results from failing to distinguish a [[dispositive]] belief (gr. 'doxa', not 'pistis') from knowledge (episteme) when the opinion is regarded ''true'' (here: orth\u00e9), in terms of right, and juristically so (according to the premises of the dialogue), which was the task of the [[rhetor]]s to prove. Plato dismisses this possibility of an affirmative relation between belief (i.e. opinion) and [[knowledge]] even when the one who opines grounds his belief on the rule, and is able to add ''justification'' (gr. [[logos]]: reasonable and necessarily plausible assertions/evidence/guidance) to it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.friesian.com/knowledg.htm \u2013 2007, 2008 Kelley L. Ross, Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nPlato has been credited for the &quot;''justified true belief''&quot; theory of knowledge, even though Plato in the [[Theaetetus (dialogue)]] elegantly dismisses it, and even posits this argument of Socrates as a cause for his death penalty.

In the case of Early Christianity, this authority was the communion of bishops, and is often referred to by the term &quot;[[Magisterium]]&quot;. The term ''orthodox'' was applied{{when|date= November 2017}} almost as an epithet to a group of Jewish believers who held to pre-Enlightenment understanding of Judaism \u2013 now known as [[Orthodox Judaism]]. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] of Christianity and the [[Catholic Church]] each consider themselves to be the true heir to Early Christian belief and practice. The antonym of &quot;orthodox&quot; is &quot;[[heterodox]]&quot;, and those adhering to orthodoxy often accuse the heterodox of [[apostasy]], [[schism (religion)|schism]], or [[heresy]].\n\n====Modernism/reform====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nThe [[Renaissance]] and later the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe exhibited varying degrees of [[religious tolerance]] and intolerance towards new and old religious ideas. The ''[[philosophes]]'' took particular exception to many of the more fantastical claims of religions and directly challenged religious authority and the prevailing beliefs associated with the established churches. In response to the liberalizing political and social movements, some religious groups attempted to integrate Enlightenment ideals of rationality, equality, and individual liberty into their belief systems, especially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Liberal Christianity]] offer two examples of such religious associations.\n\n===Approaches to others===\nAdherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions or by other [[religious denomination]]s in a variety of ways.\n\n====Exclusivism====\n{{See also|Religious exclusivism}}\nPeople with exclusivist beliefs typically explain other beliefs either as in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the [[one true faith|true faith]]. This approach is a fairly consistent feature among smaller [[new religious movement]]s that often rely on doctrine that claims a unique [[revelation]] by the [[Founders of religious traditions|founders]] or [[leader]]s, and considers it a matter of faith that the &quot;correct&quot; religion has a monopoly on truth. All three major [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic monotheistic religions]] have passages in their holy scriptures that attest to the primacy of the scriptural testimony, and indeed [[monotheism]] itself is often{{quantify|date=June 2018}} vouched{{by whom|date= November 2017}} as an innovation characterized specifically by its explicit rejection of earlier polytheistic faiths.\n\nSome exclusivist faiths incorporate a specific element of [[proselytization]]. This is a strongly-held belief in the Christian tradition which follows the doctrine of the [[Great Commission]], and is less emphasized by the Islamic faith where the [[Quran]]ic edict &quot;There shall be no compulsion in religion&quot; (2:256) is often quoted as a justification for toleration of alternative beliefs. The [[Conversion to Judaism|Jewish tradition]] does not actively seek out converts.\n\nExclusivism correlates with conservative, fundamentalist, and orthodox approaches of many religions, while pluralistic and syncretist approaches either explicitly downplay or reject the exclusivist tendencies within a religion.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n====Inclusivism====\nPeople with [[inclusivism|inclusivist]] beliefs recognize some truth in all faith [[system]]s, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences. This attitude is sometimes associated{{by whom|date= November 2017}} with [[Interfaith dialog]]ue or with the Christian [[Ecumenical]] movement, though in principle such attempts at pluralism are not necessarily inclusivist and many actors in such interactions (for example, the [[Roman Catholic Church]]) still hold to exclusivist dogma while participating in inter-religious organizations.\n\nExplicitly inclusivist religions include many that are associated with the [[New Age]] movement, as well as modern reinterpretations of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. The [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]] considers it doctrine that there is truth in all faith-systems.\n\n====Pluralism====\n{{Main|Religious pluralism}}\nPeople with [[religious pluralism|pluralist]] beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture.\n\n====Syncretism====\n{{Main|Syncretism}}\nPeople with syncretic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular [[experience]]s and contexts (''see'' [[eclecticism]]). [[Unitarian Universalism]] exemplifies a syncretic faith.\n\n===Adherence===\n{{See also|Existence of God}}\nTypical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:\n* Some see belief in a deity as necessary for [[Morality|moral behavior]].&lt;ref name=&quot;moore&quot;&gt;Compare: {{cite magazine | date= 2005-03-07 | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/110/13.0.html | title = Roy Moore: 'We Have No Morality Without an Acknowledgment of God' | magazine = [[Christianity Today]] | accessdate = 2006-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Some regard religious practices as serene, beautiful, and conducive to religious experiences, which in turn support religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Miller | first = David Ian | date = 2005-02-15 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2005/02/15/findrelig.DTL | title = Finding My Religion: Steve Georgiou on his faith and mentor, minimalist poet Robert Lax | publisher = SFGate | accessdate = 2006-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Organized religions promote a [[sense of community]] among their followers, and the moral and cultural common ground of these communities makes them attractive to people with similar [[values]].&lt;ref name=&quot;repa&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Repa | first = J.

They all promise to free adherents from spiritual bondage, and to bring them into spiritual freedom. It naturally follows that a religion which can free its adherents from deception, sin, and spiritual death will have significant mental-health benefits. [[Abraham Maslow]]'s research after [[World War II]] showed that [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors tended to be those who held strong religious beliefs (not necessarily temple attendance, etc.), suggesting that belief helped people cope in extreme circumstances. [[Humanistic psychology]] went on to investigate how religious or spiritual identity may have correlations with longer lifespan and better health. The study found that humans may particularly need religious ideas to serve various emotional needs such as the need to feel loved, the need to belong to homogeneous groups, the need for understandable explanations and the need for a guarantee of ultimate justice. Other factors may involve sense of [[purpose]], sense of [[Identity (social science)|identity]], or a sense of contact with the divine. See also ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'', by [[Viktor Frankl]], detailing his experience with the importance of religion in surviving the Holocaust. Critics assert that the very fact that religion was the primary selector for research subjects may have introduced a bias, and that the fact that all subjects were Holocaust survivors may also have had an effect. According to Larson et al. (2000), &quot;[m]ore longitudinal research with better multidimensional measures will help further clarify the roles of these [religious] factors and whether they are beneficial or harmful.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;larson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last= Larson | first = David B. |author2 = Susan S.

These include prayer appearing to account for successful resolution of problems, &quot;a bulwark against existential anxiety and fear of annihilation,&quot; an increased sense of control, companionship with one's deity, a source of self-significance, and group identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alcock |first1=James |authorlink1=James Alcock |title=The God Engine |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=32\u201338}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Apostasy===\n{{Main|Apostasy}}\n{{See also|Existence of God#Arguments against belief in God}}\nTypical reasons for rejection of religion include:\n* Some people regard certain fundamental doctrines of some religions as illogical, contrary to experience, or unsupported by sufficient [[evidence]]; such people may reject one or more religions for those reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;russell&quot;&gt;For example: {{cite web |last= Russell |first = Bertrand |authorlink = Bertrand Russell |date = 1927|url = http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell0.htm |title = Why I am Not a Christian |accessdate = 2006-05-19 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061119081311/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell0.htm |archivedate = 2006-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even some believers may have difficulty accepting particular religious assertions or doctrines. Some people believe the body of evidence available to humans to be insufficient to justify certain religious beliefs. They may thus disagree with religious interpretations of ethics and human purpose, or with various [[creation myth]]s. This reason has perhaps{{original research inline|date= November 2017}} been aggravated by the protestations and emphases of some [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]].\n* Some religions include beliefs that certain groups of people are inferior or sinful and deserve contempt, persecution, or even death, and that non-believers will be punished for their unbelief in an [[after-life]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, some [[Muslim]]s believe that women are inferior to men. Some [[Christians]] share this belief. At the time of the [[American Civil War]] of 1861\u20131865, many Southerners used passages from the [[Bible]] to justify race-based [[slavery]]. Certain campaigners have used the Christian religion as a reason to persecute and to deny the rights of homosexuals, on the basis that the Christian biblical God disapproves of homosexuality, and by implication of homosexuals. Compare http://www.godhatesfags.com&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents to a religion may feel antipathy to unbelievers. Numerous examples exist of people of one religion or sect using religion as an excuse to murder people with different religious beliefs.

Many [[atheist]]s believe that, because of this, religion is incompatible with world peace, freedom, civil rights, equality, and good government.

According to this account, individuals who together collectively believe something need not personally believe it individually. Gilbert's work on the topic has stimulated a developing literature among philosophers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} One question that has arisen is whether and how philosophical accounts of belief in general need to be sensitive to the possibility of collective belief.\n\n[[File:Snipa.JPG|thumb|right|240px| Philosopher Jonathan Glover warns that belief systems are like whole boats in the water; it is extremely difficult to alter them all at once (for example, it may be too stressful, or people may maintain their biases without realizing it).&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;]]\n[[Jonathan Glover]] (1941- ) believes that he and other philosophers ought to play some role in starting dialogues between people with deeply-held, opposing beliefs, especially if there is risk of violence. Glover also believes that philosophy can offer insights about beliefs that would be relevant to such dialogue.\n\nGlover suggests that beliefs have to be considered [[holistically]], and that no belief exists in isolation in the mind of the believer. Each belief always implicates and relates to other beliefs.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt; Glover provides the example of a patient with an illness who returns to a doctor, but the doctor says that the prescribed medicine is not working. At that point, the patient has a great deal of flexibility in choosing what beliefs to keep or reject: the patient could believe that the doctor is incompetent, that the doctor's assistants made a mistake, that the patient's own body is unique in some unexpected way, that Western medicine is ineffective, or even that Western science is entirely unable to discover truths about ailments.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;\n\nGlover maintains that any person can continue to hold any belief if they would really like to&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt; (for example, with help from [[ad hoc hypotheses|''ad hoc'' hypotheses]]). One belief can be held fixed, and other beliefs will be altered around it. Glover warns that some beliefs may not be entirely [[Explicit memory|explicitly]] believed (for example, some people may not realize they have racist belief-systems adopted from their environment as a child). Glover believes that people tend to first realize that beliefs can change, and may be contingent on their upbringing, around age 12 or 15.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;\n\nGlover emphasizes that beliefs are difficult to change. He says that one may try to rebuild one's beliefs on more secure foundations ([[axioms]]), like building a new house, but warns that this may not be possible. Glover offers the example of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], saying: &quot;[Descartes] starts off with the characteristic beliefs of a 17th-century Frenchman; he then junks the lot, he rebuilds the system, and somehow it looks a lot like the beliefs of a 17th-century Frenchman.&quot; To Glover, belief systems are not like houses but are instead like boats. As Glover puts it: &quot;Maybe the whole thing needs rebuilding, but inevitably at any point you have to keep enough of it intact to keep floating.&quot;&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;\n\nGlover's final message is that if people talk about their beliefs, they may find more deep, relevant, philosophical ways in which they disagree (e.g., less obvious beliefs, or more-deeply-held beliefs). Glover thinks that people often manage to find agreements and consensus through philosophy. He says that at the very least, if people do not convert each other, they will hold their own beliefs more [[Open-mindedness|openminded]]ly and will be less likely to go to war over conflicting beliefs.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover&gt;[http://philosophybites.com/2011/10/jonathan-glover-on-systems-of-belief.html &quot;Jonathan Glover on systems of belief&quot;, Philosophy Bites Podcast, Oct 9 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GloverBeliefs&gt;[http://www.jonathanglover.co.uk/philosophy-beliefs-and-conflicts/philosophy-beliefs-and-conflicts '' 'Philosophy, Beliefs, and Conflict' '', JonathanGlover.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe British philosopher [[Stephen Law]] (1960-) has described some belief systems (including belief in [[homeopathy]], [[psychic powers]], and [[alien abduction]]) as [[wikt:claptrap|&quot;claptrap&quot;]] and says that such belief-systems can &quot;draw people in and hold them captive so they become willing slaves of claptrap [...] if you get sucked in, it can be extremely difficult to think your way clear again&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Scientist]]'' (magazine), 11 June 2011 [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028160.200-a-field-guide-to-bullshit.html A field guide to bullshit | New Scientist] - &quot;Intellectual black holes are belief systems that draw people in and hold them captive so they become willing slaves of claptrap.
